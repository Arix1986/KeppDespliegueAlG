So it is my birthday today and I wanted to try something I have never tried in my 47 years. A McDonald's pizza or as they call it a McPizza (there are only 3 McDonald's that serve them). The Pizza and pasta were truly awesome. We did the ordering from the kiosk and proceeded to our seat. Everything was great except they didn't bring my husband's latte. So I asked the gentleman that brought the food to bring the drink. We were nearly done by the time we received it and it was incorrect. After eating we went to get the correct one and the manager had an attitude and basically filled a small cup up with milk and handed it to us. Overall the food was great. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because of the issue with the drink. We will be back but next time we will get water.,4 stars,4,1

"I came here at around 11pm last night, I ordered a spicy mcchicken medium meal, 2 cheeseburgers, and I asked for the fries fresh. I usually never have an issue when I go to other McDonald's. I order the same thing. Well its not fresh, its called ""to order"". I had to wait , no issues with that, if you want fresh food you typically have to wait for it to be made.  I got my food 8 minutes later and drove off so I could get the food to the house. Almost home, I look in the bag and grab a fry, because mcdonalds fries fresh are freaking delicious. Yeah no, I bit 5 fries all at once and they were soggy and unsalted. Highly disappointed. I tried to call and the phone just rang. I was no longer close to the mcdonalds so I just ordered the same thing at another mcdonalds closer to my destination in winter park. They actually gave me a discount and apologized for my troubles at this mcdonalds. They said they ""understood"". I wont be coming back to this mcdonalds.",1 star,1,0

Literally the worstMcD's in the world. Going through drive thru she gave us our drinks and told us to pull forward by door...then blocking the person behind us from getting out. We took initiative and parked in th he drive thru spot. Husband then went in to find out what was happening...defeating the point of drive thru. He said the staff were abysmally slow taking forever to put each item in the bag. We were starving but only ate a little. I've never had McDonald's where grease runs down your arms and the fries were revoltingly greasy too. Surprisingly none of us got food poisoning.,1 star,1,0

When this McDonald's first opened. OMG it was cool seeing the zoo theme. The animatronics made noise and moved. The service WAS excellent. But now it looks like a tourist trap. Some days you'll sit at the drive through line for a long time then get told to wait in a parking spot. Whoever owns this franchise should be proud of it and maintain it's quality that it had.

Our meal ended with the return of my absolutely revolting Chicken Alfredo which led the the main course of a Big Mac...a Big Mac has never failed me, until today. With the measliest of beef patties and sauce on the side (yes, they missed the burger), I was astonished by the lack of quality this McDonald's provided. Also, my brother's Pizza took an hour to be served and then he was argued with. 1/10 would not recommend, fire everybody.",1 star,1,0

Food should be available and fresh no matter how close it is to closing. Workers should understand that if they dont wanna work let somebody who wants to do the job. Not suprised at the amount of negative reviews but I am suprised that ownership and management does not take these reviews into consideration. Complete disgrace!

"No drive thru, enough parking. Crowded but fairly quick. They had the front doors open and I could feel the air moving, not stuffy. Mask optional at the time (July/28/22). All employees were wearing masks. All employees were pleasant or acceptably neutral and doing a good job. Bathrooms and tables clean.  Floors looked pretty good too considering the large amount of foot traffic. Indoor and outdoor tables. Whenever someone got up, a worker appeared shortly after to spray and wipe down the table. In person you can order at  cashiers or use one of the 8 self-service screens. I believe you could also order through the app. There's a scanner at the bottom of the payment pinpad.
Didn't have to wait very long for my food. Less than 5 minutes.",5 stars,5,1

"So incredibly slow once the bars closed and the drunks got hungry. Fries were old, not hot. Disorder with the 2 drive through lanes. 3 cars in the outside lane back to back to back ordered (2 if those cars should have been behind my order) while our car (knowing what we were ordering, given we had at least 20 minutes waiting in line just to get to the ordering board/microphone speaker) sat at the menu for over 5 minutes waiting to order. Overall, our drive-through wait time was forty, YES 40!!!, minutes. Will NOT go there again. Also the frequent harassment made by the half dozen homeless people begging for either money, cigarettes, food, or to wash our Windows. Clearly, they should have picked up on our lack of patience at that point and left us the %@#! Alone. McDonalds staff or management should fix that problem for others as well.",1 star,1,0

"I never leave reviews but I had to here.

Honestly, if you visited every single McDonalds in the country and ranked them I am convinced this one would be dead last.

I spent an hour in the drive-thru and when I got to the window it took 10 minutes before anyone even came to the window and when they did they had no idea what I had ordered.

I have never seen a group of people move so slowly and with such little purpose or interest  in what they were doing. It seems like they were just annoyed to be working at all. Literally it looked like the whole crew was moving in slow motion, it was a sight to see.

Then when I finally did get my food the order it was, of course, not correct. But the weird thing is they didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t short me they gave me an extra quarter pounder and fries.

When i got to the window, they told me they couldn't take it and I'd have to go back around. I told them I'd like to put in my order here since I've been waiting all this time, and they proceeded to still refuse and that it's my fault for waiting in the second lane that they claimed was closed and had a sign out. The second lane was open, and the ""sign"" they were talking about was a wet floor sign they had placed right next to the drive-thru menu. I told them the lane looked open from our side and they still proceeded to argue with me, and then slammed the drive thru window shut.

This is the worst McDonald's in New York City. The heroin users congregate at the main table in front of the register and they harass customers as they come in.

"Meh.. just meh. When I finally get the correct order, it is generally tasty. I'm a picky eater, and have found ways to navigate the menu to get items I like. Worked in the service industry for years as a server, bartender, and trainer. Taking and fulfilling orders is NOT hard, tedious at times though. I only go here when I see they are not busy, in hope that my order is correct when I go to leave. In the 10 times that I have been here in the past past year, I have only had 1 order that was perfectly correct. Just ONE, not an exaggeration. That one order was just 2 large fries and nothing else. Though I will mention that when I got home and pulled them out of the bag, they were hardly what you'd call filled, (nor did I enjoy any on the 3 minute drive home) so little so that I even sent a picture and post to McDonald's on Facebook, at least the few were hot. The evening staff is very pleasant, but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired, as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in Spanish out in the open which, being a light skinned Puerto Rican, I understand perfectly. I have submitted several complaints and NEVER received a call or email back. I just don't go here anymore to avoid the stress of paying money for something that is most likely wrong.",1 star,1,0

Ordered our food at 9:05pm got our order at 9:30 my niece ordered a Belgian waffle at 9:30 on the dot at 10:00pm it still wasn't ready so I asked very politely bc I'm a very nice person if they had made our order # for the waffle the guy said it wasn't ready, but we stood there watching them make waffles and throw them on the shelf so I asked was 1 of the waffles my order he went to check each ticket and sadly not 1 of them was my the order #. I also witnessed him ask 1 of the workers about it. She was an older woman when I say she was very rude didn't care and walked off as he was asking her so at that point I just wanted a refund. Oh no, but it doesn't stop there got in the car my whole order was cold and the lack of work they put into making food is ridiculous. I do not recommend this place and we will never come here again.

Doesn't deserve a single star. My burger was slopply made and half sticking out of the box. Way to much pepper poured on the chicken and gave us a drink instead of a shake that I ordered.

Busy night, but able to order our meals from the auto screens instead of counter, and pay. Cool, since in Georgia they haven't caught on at many yet. Ordered several meals and customized my Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich meal to include bacon, pickles, and cheese, and a large fry. Service was great for me. They managed to work around us and keep things clean in the eating areas and bathrooms. Enjoyed the experience. Went back for dessert, but paid at the counter, and let them know we appreciated the service.",3 stars,3,0

All that in front of the manager ..

Besides that waiting time was ridiculous long with a lot of customers not satisfied and even a uber eats guy had to cancel in front of  me because they didn't make his order in more than 20 min that I was there ...

Another lady in the back was not using the yellow paper that sandwiches have she was placing the  buns/bread directly on the table as she was preparing food for dogs. She saw me and start acting like nothing happened..

You're going to have a catastrophic accident there if you don't get two lanes drawn up. Number two, Sylvia should not be arguing with the customers in line and she did not serve us. I never use profanity I told her it was unprofessional and that it could have caused an accident and other people were telling her the same.I'm very disappointed how McDonald's has lowered the bar in hiring people that will argue with their customers when the  are trying to prevent an accident.

It took the Blue Shirt Manager realizing nothing was being done up front to get anything done. She realized the Maroon Shirt Manager had the phone off the hook for 4 hours, apologizing, correcting issues, and holding people accountable to get anything going.

As an employee of McDonald's I usually give them the benefit of the doubt but the nuggets we ordered were fried together making them raw in the middle and still served.  And never in a my years of working for McDonald's have I ever had undercooked fries that tasted hours old.,3 stars,3,0
"No cashiers/order takers; you must use their self-service kiosk which they have several of. You take a number sign to your table and staff will deliver your order to your table; however, this wasn't the case for us. The employee came from around the counter and yelled our number while she stood in the nearly empty lobby. We were seated less than 6 feet away from her and in her line-of-sight. We raised our hand and said, ""that's us"". She saw us, but made no attempt to deliver the food. I don't mind getting up and getting the food from her despite the kiosk saying it would be delivered to our table, but, I'm feeling a little like an unpaid employee at this point...we placed the order ourselves as well as served ourselves the food despite paying the same amount for the food that a full-service McDonald's charges. Several people in-store and in drive thru returned food due to being cold, old or not made correctly. This included us...at 1:00 in the afternoon the nuggets were cold, chewy and seemed old. I would think this wouldn't be the case given 1:00 p.m. is during the lunch rush. Fries were cold presumably because they were sitting on the tray well before the rest of the food was ready. Double cheeseburger was made correctly (no mustard or pickles), but bun was not warm/dry and cheese was cold/not melted. 4 managers were in the kitchen (button-up shirts with ties) along with 6 employees yet there was a lot of standing around doing nothing and operating with a shuffle-paced, leisurely-stroll walk. I worked at McDonald's and Burger King as a teenager and was always told, ""If you got time to lean, you've got time to clean"", and that was during slow/dead times, not lunch rush. I will say that the manager I returned my double cheeseburger and fries to (we ended up just eating our stale nuggets because we were told it was going to be 5-10 minutes for fresh ones) was nice and when I told her she could just microwave my burger she insisted on making a new one.",1 star,1,0

"This was a horrible experience and a waste of 4 hours and almost $100. The place was terribly overcrowded and dirty. There was standing room only, shoulder to shoulder. We stood in line for 20 minutes at a kiosk to order, then after we ordered it said there was an error and we had to wait another 40 minutes in the line at the register anyway to order. All of the workers were super rude. I was even on the elevator with 2 workers talking about a customer saying ""I have no obligation to answer your questions or do anything for these people"" and then talking about how gross a customer was and saying she would point her out to the other employee. Nobody was at all helpful and even seemed to be angry when we asked for anything.  My daughter tried to fill her cup with sweet tea and the older lady standing at the drink station didnt let her fill it up all the way. The only nice person was the old guy emptying the trash on the 2nd floor. We spent over $60 for my kids to play the arcade games, then they shut and locked the prize counter. A while later, we had to ask someone to open it so they could redeem their tickets and 3 employees tried over the course of the next hour and no one could get it back open. I tried talking to a manager about it, but she gave me about 10 seconds of her time just to tell me there was nothing she could do but send someone up to the ticket counter for us... she didn't even listen to us explain that it others had tried before she just walked away. We are from out of state and my kids were so excited to see this place but we all left miserable. At least the sandwiches were warm (though the fries were soggy).",1 star,1,0

"I usually frequent McDonald's at least once a week, whether its to grab a coffee or get some pancakes for my little one. This visit was probably the worst I've experienced. I ordered my food at 9:11AM - A mcgriddle, a coffee, and two hashbrowns. Once I paid I was immediately told to go to #1, so I did. After waiting until 9:30AM with no one in the drive thru line anymore I went back around where a female with red hair came walking out with a guy who looked like they knew each other. After handing me my bag, I asked about my drink and she said ""What drink"", I said the coffee that's listed on the ticket you provided me along with the receipt. She said okay and then CONTINUED to hold a conversation with the guy standing right in front of me. I waited an additional 2 minutes and she was still talking and laughing with the guy while me, a customer was watching her and patiently waiting for my coffee.

Worst mcdonald's ever this morning I went inside no cashier they told me to use kiosk to order my food. I ordered and then had to wait 30 minutes this was so crazy and then I asked to speak with a manager and then I had to wait about another 15 min and then no staff members would speak English. They all need an attitude adjustment. I will never ever go to this Mcdonald's again never ever had to wait 45 min for a cup of coffee!!!! Please don't go and spend your money here!!!,1 star,1,0

The place is huge with people from all places checking it out too.
It's 2nd floor is full of arcade games and a children's play area.
They have a pasta and pizza section with a brick oven.
They have multiple touch screen ordering kiosks with people always in queue.
I ordered online with the McDonald's app and picked it up in store or else I would have waited in line.
The whole store is bright and clean including the restrooms.

I even repeated myself to hold the catsup twice at the microphone and asked at the window again to insure she understood to hold the catsup on the burger and was meet with a very curt ""yes, I heard you"". Guess what , not only did they not hold the catsup but it was over loaded with extra catsup and I got a regular coke.  Well at least the fries were right.

"PLEASE CHECK YOUR TO GO ORDERS BEFORE YOU LEAVE!! I would give negative stars, if I could. I ordered a to go order, but ended up staying to eat in the dining room.  I opened my quarter pounder hamburger and it was turned upside down with all of the toppings splattered onto the box as if it was slapped in there. It literally had no top hamburger bun, and when I brought this up to the cashier she said that this is what a ""quarter hamburger"" was. When I asked for just a top hamburger bun at least and showed the cashier the burger she didn't even apologize or offer to remake the burger she just snatched the box out of my hands. I paid for this burger and was only asking for the bun, not making a scene or demanding anything or being rude. I had chosen to not acknowledge the mess it was because there are enough verbally abusive patrons. But all the cashier ended up doing was turn the burger right side up (no gloves) and slap an undercooked bun on it, and yell at the other adult woman at the grill about ""what's missing here?"". It wasn't even busy in the drive thru or the dining room. I can't pretend to know their job or lives, but I hope they aren't this effed up to every PAYING customer. I ended up asking for a refund, and not taking the burger, even this was an issue. Please beware!! I only regret not getting their names to report them. Again, not trying to be  a drama queen but I worked hard to afford this little splurge to get this slap in the face.",1 star,1,0

"Biscayne Blvd., and 35th Street
Based upon what I observed and experienced at the drive-thru window with 4 employees (one who couldn't even understand or speak English), I made a complaint to McDonald's yesterday and will wait to hear from someone with the franchise owner's organization.  The owner needs to know how poorly managed this restaurant is, and how inadequately the employees are trained to do their jobs.  I also have contacted and submitted a written complaint to Chris Kempczinski, CEO of McDonald's, as well as Steve Easterbrook who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of McDonald's in Chicago.  They need to understand why McDonald's is doing so poorly; afterall, when they have to communicate to their Board members and investors about a drop in multiple quarterly revenues and earnings over the past year, maybe then they will take a look at how poorly they select, train and manage their employees to create a positive customer experience with stellar service. I will not be going to this, or any other, McDonald's again!  It was that bad.  McDonald's corporation needs to do a thorough investigation of how this restaurant is NOT being properly managed by the franchise owner and managers.  The owner clearly must put numbers before people.  Horrible, horrible experience!  Will stick with Wendy's instead.  They have much better food and service!

04/05/2021 - As a follow-up to my complaint to McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s 1-800#, and the CEO, I did receive a written response and phone call.  Kathy was very appreciative of the feedback received and thorough in her explanation of actions taken as a result of a completed investigation.  I was also compensated for the experience I had at this McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s.

"Despite it being rush hour in Miami Beach, the place didn't seem dirty nor the restrooms. The is no parking near the McDonalds so you'd have to find a way to park yourself. Customer Interaction was minimal, which was good(for me), because this McDonalds had a purchasing mechanism for people to buy whatever they want there and receive a receipt to show the cashier and you're basically done, all that's left is waiting for your food. Quick Tip: You are able to pay with cash if you prepurchase, but the money will go to the cashier, not the mechanism. The mechanism does accept any kind of Credit/Debit card.",5 stars,5,1

"I'd like to start by saying I always go in to place my order because no matter where I go, my order gets messed up, maybe its because I don't like cheese. I went in to place my order and head towards the counter, an employee standing in between the kiosks points me towards them. I said to her I only place my food order with humans. The employee heads towards the register to take my order. She says she hopes she can use it. She took my order but had to have help. I didn't mean to be flippant but I said ""so you're job is to help people at the kiosks?"" She said yes. The food was ok, the place was clean but my point here is, this is what's going to happen with a 15 dollar  minimum wage. One person will be employed to oversee the kiosks but people lost their jobs already and replaced by machines. I'd rather keep a human working than have them replaced by a machine, not to mention how many germs are on said machine that they want you to order food from. About a month ago there was a story on the news that almost 99 percent of kiosks tested (everywhere) had a presence of fecal matter. So no kiosks or self checkout for me.",3 stars,3,0

I guess they got to rip off their guests to afford the building the management staff are rude when you order a shake medium it comes in a little small kids cup I order two Filet-O-Fish fish or they're not offering the 2 for 5  but that's okay they're not even putting tartar sauce on the sandwich I was just bread  the Fish so I guess they had to cut  cost somewhere when they charge you $15 for fish and don't put anything  on it. I won't go back. Here is how to save some money fire some of those managers that are rude for your guests and that'll save you some money and start building the sandwich correctly,1 star,1,0

I came here on my way to a meeting in the convention center. I had 20 minutes to be where I needed to be so I figured I would swing by this McDonald's and grab some food. Boy was that a mistake. I arrived at this McDonald's at 11:45. I did not order my food at the drive-thru window until 10 minutes after 12:00. By the time I actually got my food it was closer to 12:30. This has to be the absolute slowest McDonald's in the history of any restaurant in the world. It has double drive throughs and they seem to prefer the inside Lane to the outside lane. They were taking the orders of customers on the inside line too if not three to one. Not exactly sure what was going on inside the building. But they were slower than molasses. I understand that there is issues right now with finding employees for a little bit of prep work would have sped up the process a little bit. That's why I gave them three stars instead of one.,3 stars,3,0

With the size of the big breakfast that would starve a child. Maybe you should start calling it baby breakfast. If you don't get cakes with it then you have over half a tray of just a bite of eggs two small strips of bacon and a dry/hard biscuit. I think a total of six bites and two minutes with phone in hand while eating and it was gone. There goes almost ten bucks.,1 star,1,0

Went to this location around 3am and placed an order through the app. Waited in the drive thru for 20+ minutes with other cars to then be told they are closed only. The manager refused to refund my order and also refused to give me her name. The manager that works there during the night should not be in management and lacks customer service skills along with the other 3 employees that refused to acknowledge us at the drive thru window. This location needs training from corporate and should not have the open 24 hours a day signs on their windows. Very disappointed in my experience at this McDonald's.,1 star,1,0

"Our visit was on Friday, 5/12/2023. There is a marked improvement in the service and cleanliness at this location on Ft. Hamilton Parkway. Katherine, the Manager, and her staff (Chris) promptly offered help and solutions to my family's needs. The use of a dedicated staff member to continuously clean the dining area was a big plus. I only feel that the beverage station should be closer to the dining area to facilitate the transfer of drinks from station to table; particularly for the disabled.
Another, concern was the price of the food. Though there were ""dollar"" options available, the price of the more popular sizes and items was very high. A median-income family of four would be wary of dining more than once a month, if that often.
The name of the counter person that helped us during our visit was Chris. He is a credit to the McDonalds company.",4 stars,4,1

The owner of this McDonald's needs to read this.  When you have a breakfast special  you should want to please the customer. If the customer wants 2 sausage biscuits instead of 2 bacon biscuits  are a customer would prefer a a certain type of bread for there breafast sandwich special you should not put stipulations on what type of bread they want.  Other McDonald's have catered to my needs if your not willing to cater to customer needs then you will have less customers.  Also charging for ranch not everyone can eat ketchup because of acid and stomach problems and need ranch for there fries instead of ketchup. Anyone that says they need ranch for there fries are hashbrown not just chicken nuggets because they have stomach issues you should make exception to that for that.  And one last thing.  Your workers look miserable not one of them smiles at me im very outgoing person.  You need to explain to your workers that there attitudes are sour and need to cheer up. We all have bad days but when somone looks like they hate being there based off of there unfriendly customer service then they need more training.   Night service is better from my experience but the morning service needs to be looked at.  It's not fun to drive up and the worker gives you that look like they hate you and shows no customer service skills at all. Thank you for your understanding. Take my advice and you will have more customers,1 star,1,0

"Pretty awesome place. On top of your standard items, they sell pasta, pizza and pastries. Surprisingly, the pizza and pasta was quite good, for McDonalds. The place also offers a very reasonable arcade, $5 unlimited play for 30 minutes. The only draw back to the timed purchase is that you don't earn tickets. They do have a trade in booth with prizes for your tickets.

"If I could give this place 0 stars, believe me, I would. By far the worst McDonald's I have EVER been to in the world. I came in to buy a bottle of water (would never even consider eating here given the lack of cleanliness). I waited about five minutes until someone finally told me that they do not have any bottles left. I told them a large fountain water was fine, with ice. Keep in mind - MAYBE 2 people at this McDonald's speak English. Luckily this woman understood me when I communicated what I wanted. I watched her get the cup, fill it with ice, and place it beside the machine! For someone that is just waiting for a drink, pour it, and hand it to the customer. There were maybe a dozen people waiting for their orders. I did not have any other items to wait for - just the water. I waited another 5 minutes to see if someone would just hand me the cup. No one did. I pushed my way through to the front, and got my cup. It was absolute chaos in there; a brutally unorganized establishment. The cashier could have simply turned around, gotten me the bottle of water (or in this case, tell me there are none and pour me a fountain drink), and be on my way. Wasted 10-15 minutes in this place.",1 star,1,0

"McDonalds was fine; the people I went with sucked. But honestly this place is really sketch, they even have a security guard at the front door in case things go sideways. If you are wondering HOW things could go sideways, you wouldn't have to expand your view further then the amount of druggys that go to this McDonalds. Half of them don't even buy anything, they just stand around (to heat up I presume) waiting for the security to kick them out. The other half stand in line and figure out that they can't buy anything at the front desk then leave. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this if they kept to themselves like everyone else ordering something at the McDonald's, but they would  randomly yell, ask questions, pan handle, and just were being a general nuisance. I understand that an establishment can't control who their costumers are, so it's not exactly the MD's fault, but still this Micky D's should be avoided at all costs for that reason. I give them 2 stars instead of one because the good customer service and magically clean bathroom. Seriously these cashiers have to deal with a lot of weird stuff and they somehow aren't mentally broken by the end of the day. I went at 11 at night which probably affects my review, but from the first impression I'm not inclined to go again to find out how it is in the day unless it was simultaneously the only restaurant, I was starving more than a communist in the gulag, and I lost my ability to cook food myself.

"Biscayne Blvd., and 35th Street
Based upon what I observed and experienced at the drive-thru window with 4 employees (one who couldn't even understand or speak English), I made a complaint to McDonald's yesterday and will wait to hear from someone with the franchise owner's organization.  The owner needs to know how poorly managed this restaurant is, and how inadequately the employees are trained to do their jobs.  I also have contacted and submitted a written complaint to Chris Kempczinski, CEO of McDonald's, as well as Steve Easterbrook who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of McDonald's in Chicago.  They need to understand why McDonald's is doing so poorly; afterall, when they have to communicate to their Board members and investors about a drop in multiple quarterly revenues and earnings over the past year, maybe then they will take a look at how poorly they select, train and manage their employees to create a positive customer experience with stellar service. I will not be going to this, or any other, McDonald's again!  It was that bad.  McDonald's corporation needs to do a thorough investigation of how this restaurant is NOT being properly managed by the franchise owner and managers.  The owner clearly must put numbers before people.  Horrible, horrible experience!  Will stick with Wendy's instead.  They have much better food and service!

"Since I'm known as ""Jimmy McRib"" I had to take the opportunity of visiting the world's largest McDonalds, even though it meant and extra hour and fifteen minute drive each way....  Anyways, this place is huge, and legendary among fast food junkies like myself for the fact that they serve pizza and pasta.  I would have been more impressed if they had the McRib too, but it was not to be, even at the world's largest McDonalds.

This was an incredibly busy place, even at 9:30pm.  There are tons of local hotels and tourists were everywhere, with most of them speaking a language besides English.  The restaurant wasn't the cleanest, but that had to be due to the fact that they are open 24/7 and always busy.  To my surprise, the bathrooms were very clean and nice.

Anyways, what is unique at this McDonalds:
- Hand dipped hard ice cream
- Multiple stories, with an arcade and playland upstairs
- A pizza and pasta section
- A big fish tank in the lobby

It was difficult to get into the parking lot due to construction and traffic, but there was plenty of parking.  The one side of the building has a giant neon Ronald McDonald which was cool.  I wanted to try the pizza or pasta, but unfortunately I had eaten a nice dinner about an hour earlier and only had room for a hamburger, which I ordered through the app.  It was pretty hectic inside, with tons of kiosks for ordering, which was helpful since they had different language selections to match the language of those ordering.  Some of my family got hand scooped ice cream, but it was a nightmare, as nobody was working that section, and we had to wait ten minutes after waiting in the busy line at the counter to ask for somebody to help us.  But, they eventually got their hard ice cream and it was good.

It was definitely neat to see this McDonalds, but it was a bit too busy for me, and the workers said that this was light traffic as compared to how busy it gets during the day.",4 stars,4,1

McDonalds is my go to fast food restaurant. It has been the only place since my son was a baby that we have been able to go to get a quick bite to eat due to his severe dairy allergy. Yes they have a dairy free meal for him and for me a gluten free meal. A match you can't beat.

Both the chicken and doubles had no - no - no flavor at all and was dry as sawdust and cardboard. For the sodas one was a diet coke and other was a reg coke, both were large size which they did not get right the first time. Both sodas tasted like they were full of cinnamon flavor.

The food was over dry and tasteless. The staff at this location needs to learn how to throw away yesterday's old food..if not last weeks old junk..

"If we focus too much on ourselves and the troubles in our lives, it is very difficult to be happy. Lord, refresh my spirit, help me let go of longing to become something I am not and show me how to be the best of who I am.
Open your mind and empty your heart of fears so that you can know and experience God to the fullest. Lord, You are my peace, my assurance and the love that I hold on to.Reach higher than you think possible for all that you want and you find that often you attain even more. Lord, I rely on Your promises made to each of us and especially on Your love.
Be patient with others, but mostly be patient with yourself. Lord, help me to keep a smile on my face and to realize my goodness and refuse to dwell on my imperfections.Desiring more and more without appreciating what you have right now will never allow you to be truly happy. Be grateful for the gifts you are receiving right this very minute. That's happiness!God gives abundantly to those who pass His gifts on to others. Lord, let Your blessings flow in to me and then out from me. I will neither be selfish nor let my gifts stagnate.
Use Jesus' as your example on how to live. Lord, You will guide and advise us and then You will leave it to us to decide our own future. Give us wisdom in our choices.Dear Lord, thank you for being such a loving God and caring about our pain. You don't want to see us suffer. You know the suffering that we face, and I ask that you would please redeem it and bring it to an end. In the midst, Lord, I believe that you are sufficient.

"Place was not noticeable based on the Google maps direction, I ended up looking for a while for it because it is missing the iconic double arches people know. I was looking within the mall area because of the map description, and wished I was across the street as it would have been easier to see. When I entered to place an order, one of the cashier's had an upset look or scowling face towards most customers, and unfriendly look. I didn't like her look so I stepped to the next cashier and I ordered it was fast, I ordered a Happy Meal and was asked if this is for a boy or girl (assuming a toy choice here). I get the order, no toy! And asked all they said was ""no toy, sorry"". I left, I'm not surprised by the lower than usual reviews here. Also when eating my food I ordered triple cheese burger but got doubles instead, at least I was charged for double only.",1 star,1,0
Its hit or miss here. Sometimes its fast sometimes it takes forever to get your food. The one thing I must say is unlike other mcdonalds they always get your order right so that is definitely a plus. It is a little more expensive too because it's in Manhattan/Chinatown. If you go to the bronx or brooklyn it cost you less.,3 stars,3,0

It's dirty, restroom has no water or soap to wash hands, except if you use the handicap toilet which makes me wonder how often or ever the employees wash their hands before return back to work. My husband got quite sick the following day because of the food.

We placed the order on the machine for dine-in with table service but there was not a single table # tent available, well the store make it clear that you as a customer should better pickup your own food at the counter. There's absolutely no service at all.

We waited for about 3 minutes to be acknowledged. A young lady with a yellow shirt possibly a manager was facing her back to the window and she talked to the cashier. It took for me to honk in order for her to open the window to take my payment. Not once did she say anything to us. Not a greet nor an apology. Just took my credit card and gave me my receipt. I drove to the next window where another young girl was. She gave me my food and I asked her if the lady in the yellow shirt was a manager and she said yes. I then asked her for her name and she has the nerve to say "" I actually don't know her name I just got back but I'll ask"". What??? How do you not know who the manager on duty is. I left. The service was extremely poor for no reason at all. I ordered 2 happy meals and a nd chicken. I think that's an easy order. Horrible service. The manager did not look happy. As a matter of fact she seemed unhappy. She chose to work retail and chose to be a manager.",1 star,1,0

If I can give this place ZERO stars I would! I went through drive through and cashier informed me to wait on line 1. So I drove and parked while I was waiting a lot of vehicles passed through. There was an older lady with red hair giving out deliveries of food so I was wondering when my order was going to come out waiting there for 30minutes or Longer. So I walked inside asking for my order and come to find out that my order was given to someone else! So they had to put my order again through the system so I can get my food so again Now I had to wait for others to come out before mine because my order was last in line. Food wasn't warm once I got it and fries had salt when I ordered no salt.

This is hands-down without argument the worse McDonald's in America do not waste your time go somewhere else. Literally just a drive-thru is open and they still have to stop for 10 to 15 minutes to get there s*** back together numerous times have I been in the Drive-Thru and had to wait 30 minutes plus for these stupid MFrs to figure out how to do their job correctly!!! You just need to close down this location and let a fast food company that knows what they're doing take over it!! There is another McDonald's less than three minutes from this McDonald's I highly encourage you to go to that one,1 star,1,0

"This was one of the worst McDonald's that I've ever been to. I went to the one on Warm Springs and Las Vegas Blvd, the customer service was excellent, they greeted us and made us feel like they cared. We Sked for no onions, we got just that. Our fries were fresh and hot. We wanted more and our tea was watery as we has already started down the Blvd, we went to the next McDonald's that we saw. We ordered fries and a double cheeseburger with no onions. We pulled up to the pay window and asked if we could trade the sweet tea and showed our receipt, the lady told us to ask at the next window, we pay and pull forward. The next person says no we dont do that, I asked for a supv, she explained to me that the other was a franchise and they are corporate. I accepted that. My fries were stale and my burger has onions. I sent them back, they then tasted like they redropped the same fries in the chicken nugget oil. I will never go there again.",1 star,1,0

Always try to get orders out on an unrealistic timer ever for a fast food place and once that happens they close out the order and make you pull to the side to wait for food while 3, 4 people behind get to leave with there orders.

I work at Ponderosa Steakhouse next door to this McDonalds. I have visited this location many times. When there is no business and its slow the workers just stand around talking like nothing going on. I've tried to place my order many times in hopes that I'd receive my food fast enough to get my food and head to work next door before I have to clock in and start my shift. The management is slow and doesn't help out as I figured they wouldn't. My mother went here as well after dropping my off at work to only experience this as well. Many people have to wait foreverrrrr just to get a simple order. The last time I went I just ordered an ice coffee French vanilla and instead of handing me the ice coffee they placed it besides a counter and made me wait 12 minutes for it. I didn't ask anyone this time because im just feed up with this location. If you want McDonalds DO NOT! and I repeat DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION!!!

Floors looked pretty good too considering the large amount of foot traffic. Indoor and outdoor tables. Whenever someone got up, a worker appeared shortly after to spray and wipe down the table. In person you can order at  cashiers or use one of the 8 self-service screens. I believe you could also order through the app. There's a scanner at the bottom of the payment pinpad.

"To be honest, I usually frequent this local Santa Monica Micky D's for its coffee. I have to wake up pretty early, so a nice jolt of caffeine helps me start the day at 5am. With that being said, I will also say that because of Santa Monica's influx of homelessness over the years, this particular location gets alot of homeless patrons. Most are nice, and I buy some of the regulars a thing or two from time to time; however, it's the aggressive homeless patrons that make the place feel troublesome. The staff tries to placate situations, but you can tell they are getting frustrated more and more everyday.

Stopped in for fast coffee but instead had the pleasure of watching Angelica work her customer service magic. She took the time to rework a customers order to take advantage of saving.

"This is one of the best McDonalds I have been to. They were closed for several months due to construction. The great food and service has made up for the time when they were not operational. The food is always hot and the Buns so far have been fresh and soft. The best thing about McDonald's are the FRIES!!!!  Their fries are always fresh, hot, and delicious. The best part is they stand straight up in the box just as they do on the commercials and pictures. I don't mind waiting in the sometimes long drive-thru line for fresh food.

Well just because that McDonald's is on international drive which is in the tourist area doesn't give him the right to jack up their prices and I go up and down international drive quite a bit I drive charter buses and because their prices are jacked up so high I won't bring a busload of people there now the young lady that brought my lunch out you know she was very very friendly very nice young lady the restaurant is clean but your prices are way too high and until they come down I will not bring 50 60 people in my bus to that location just because you're on international drive don't mean you can rip people off and that's all you're doing when I can take them four miles down the road to a Burger King and their prices are a lot lot lower so if you want to start seeing more charter buses come in there with people lower your prices,3 stars,3,0

"It's unfortunate that after today,  I'll be going to the McDonald's on Beach. 3yrs here, 7 days a week I order a large mocha.   I've seen the management change about 7 people and I've made some friends.
All those people are gone. I made a direct complaint recently because I've had enough,  you'd think I'd go to a different McDonald's with ""that ""many issues right? Well, I don't think I should have had to drive further for their lack of customer service, but...its not changing. My complaint was handled fast and efficient. I come to retrieve my mocha and it tasted weird, a couple of days ago. I came back and was asked to park in 3 for it to be re made. I then gave it back to the lady and told her to please let the manager know I wasn't satisfied with the drink, we both laughed and she said ok.
Yesterday, I waited an hr because it was raining crazy...for a doordash. They gave the wrong item first and I had to reorder.
Today I go, and retrieve my mocha again, and the manager ask me how many were promised to me? I let her know,  the last one I came back and returned and told the girl somethings wrong with it,  it's taste burnt.  The gm says , I saw you yesterday and I know I gave you a free mocha. To me...that is calling me a liar. Especially when you repeat it after I tell you ,I didn't come yesterday,  I doordashed and yall messed that up. I also have dash receipts to show.
She then says I didn't call you a liar, but I know I gave you a free one. She then tells me her staff shared that I drive up without ordering. No. Have you ever experienced that? I'm here daily! When I told her her staff isn't at the window, just as she wasn't when I pulled up*today*  she said something was wrong with the speaker...No, accept some accountability.  The last manager told me she was Rosa and that's not the same lady I complained on. Anywho,  I told her I'm not the problem and I'm not sure why this hasn't been fixed yet,  but today I've decided to switch locations. lol drive further for good customer service, Rosa, thank you for at least responding today.

"Sometimes the closing hours are not reliable! I cant tell you how many times I've had to cancel an uber eats order for delivery because somewhere the order was accepted but this place was closed! Disappointing to the customer who was looking forward to that late night/wee hours of the morning food and infuriating to me because that's MY TIME wasted and money not going into MY pocket! aka not getting paid for delivery!

On a personal note, I've had MANY upon MANY confrontations with the people who give me the food - I ONLY drink REGULAR dr pepper and as an avid soda drinker since elementary school (now 51) I know the difference between regular and diet - it seems like if you come here after a certain hour, even though I've asked for REGULAR DR PEPPER, I always seem to get one that tastes like a diet one! I have had them give me 3 dr peppers in one drive thru order just to end up with something that clearly was NOT a regular one!!! In addition to having the attitudes checked from those that gave me BIG ATTITUDE for being so, I guess ""insistent that this was not regular dr pepper, I would also examine the machines when they run low or tell the employees not to outright LIE about giving me regular dr pepper just to keep $1.40 - which btw, I'm curious as to why I was charged $1.41 for a large at this location when I'm ALWAYS charged $1.40 at the one on mathilda!!!????",2 stars,2,0

Stopped in for fast coffee but instead had the pleasure of watching Angelica work her customer service magic. She took the time to rework a customers order to take advantage of saving.

My Apple pie was questionable to if it was even a pie or not.

As we pulled away from the drive-thru and continued on our way to our final destination, we realized that they gave us the wrong order. We spent about $20, but only received maybe $5 worth of food. The lobby was closed, the line was long, and we were too tired to turn back. I tried calling this location more than 3 times and even submitted a complaint/help request via the McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s app to try and get some sort of resolution to their mistake, yet I still have notignoring all of my attempts?",1 star,1,0

"After exploring Chinatown in lower Manhattan, I decided to walk to the only McDonald's in the immediate area, on the south side of Canal Street. It didn't look like much from the outside, but once I entered I walked up to the counter to order one coffee which took a few minutes since the place was somewhat busy and there was a customer in line in front of me.

I got my order and walked upstairs to the first level and sat at a comfortable booth. Within a few minutes a manager came to my table to ask if everything was OK, and I told him ""Yes"", but I was having trouble to connect to the free WiFi. He immediately helped me with this and although the connection was slow, I was pleased that the problem was solved.

Then the manager chatted with me and asked if I would mind doing a survey and I filled out the online survey. Then he said I was entitled to a free burger so I had a Big Mac.

Placed our order that would include the discount when code was applied. Pulled up to the window to a frumpy red-headed clown of an employee that promptly slammed the card reader through my window with nigh a word. I asked to have our discount code applied, and he begrudgingly got his scanner out to read the QR code, but he had wrung the order up incorrectly, so the discount was not applying. He requested assistance from his manager, and their solution was to add a second premium drink to the order at an up charge. All staff came across dower and melancholy. Even when I commented that I was concerned about the accuracy, and that this had been a terrible experience, I was ignored.

One sauce dispensor just explodes pop knocks the container out of my hand under strong pressure. Gets little sauce on my clothes, not too bad but Jesus Christ...

They both had no lettuce and tomato on them. I call them about it and they were glad to replace them. I go back and 10mims later we get hot fries and two sandwiches but both had onions and pickles on them..

THEN, my order was wrong so I go inside to get a refund only to see my receipt had about 15 streks of ink on it nothing legible. SO I go inside and say I would like my money back and the manager just shrugs me off like it doesn't effect her.

"Extremely rude and impatient. I asked for 3 water cups with my 40$ meal and I got a glare and only one cup.  Then my brother who ordered a 20 piece nugget went up to ask for sauce because they didn't include any that we asked for, after waiting patiently and then asking several times he got 2 of the 4 he asked for.  He came back frustrated with only 2 so I told him to go back for more. He asked the manager 4 times to her face very nicely for 2 more and she just looked at him each time and went the other way. Eventually a kind fellow customer next to him reached over the counter and just took sauce for my brother. Not impressed",1 star,1,0

"Do you want dysentery, cholera, or one of the ""Big-5""? Then eat here, otherwise you would be wise to avoid this McDonalds as if it were the plague. Immediately upon walking through the door I was stunned by an extremely offensive and pungent odor. It was so difficult to focus on much else due to the severity of the smell. This was not a smell of hamburgers or French fries, this was the smell of spilled milk that had soured and marred in the 100+ Texas heat for weeks. Truly, this smell is likely from the repeated spilling of soda at the drink stations that had either been overlooked or merely disregarded by careless employees. Beyond the smell, the sights were just as appalling. There were trays with discarded food and wrappers lining the tables as well as smashed food around the floor. Granted the trays are the result of lazy and inconsiderate people that believe they shouldn't be required to tend to their mess; the employee's should have direction from management to conduct a lobby check at set periods to ensure this doesn't result in customer  dissatisfaction. All this being said, I simply walked into the lobby to order a drink and I would have been on my merry way. I stood at the counter and waited for one of the cashiers to acknowledge that they were ready to take my order. I received numerous glances from, who I assumed was, the front of store worker. I was the only customer in line in the lobby, but understood that there was also a drive through at which customers were present. I waited a bit longer, received additional glances from previously said employees. Still, I was not asked for my order. I was doing nothing that would have given the appearance that I was unready to order. I was not on the phone, not fiddling with my wallet; I was standing quietly, intently looking at multiple employees that dismissed my presence. 4 employees present, 2 managers in the back and zero orders from me. This normally would not have been an issue, I would have waited a bit longer, but the lack of regard for cleanliness and the piercing stench that wafted throughout the lobby forced me to leave. I'm not likely to enter this facility nor purchase any product from this store after today. If the management and workers leave the front of the store in such a state, it forces me to wonder about the areas where customers cannot see. To all those that dare enter, 'ye be warned'.",1 star,1,0

When you order at a kiosk, you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream.  Then you wait 15+ minutes to find out they don't have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one, which she doesn't know how to do so you end up paying $4+ for a cup of ice cream.  I did get my money back for the ice cream because I couldn't believe it took that long.

Just when the cashier told us of the kindness, the tow guy called... he was one hour early! I didn't even see what type of car the kind people drove or get to wave thanks. I must add that my fish sandwich came with the extra sauce and the French fries were piping hot. Perfect ice in the drink and the right mix, too. They even gave us extra napkins! Can I just say a very humble thank you to all involved?",5 stars,5,1

I finally thought It was fixed, so when I left and got to my destination, I realize this INUTILE a cashier only ordered me one hash brown instead of four.

"This McDonald's did not live up to the hype I saw on the internet. It was crowded and small. I entered and all of my expectations dropped. I ordered at the kiosk since the line was long. All of the items I've seen online through social media were either unavailable or not there at all. I saw the ""famous"" pizza and pasta, I tried the pizza. After ordering my food and sweets, I waited at the only table I could find that wasn't already taken. I ordered a small drink so I figured if I had to wait maybe they would at least bring me the cup so I can get a drink, I was wrong. I made a special request for my McFlurry and within minutes of ordering, I was told my special request couldn't be done since they had already made my McFlurry. I thought they would make the ice cream items last so they don't melt while waiting for the food. I didn't order much, and I know there was a line but I received the pizza faster than anything. I waited for a total of 30 minutes for the rest of my food. They waited until everything was done to bring it to me and it wasn't even good. The chicken was dry and looked old, my burger was cold, my McFlurry was made wrong so I didn't eat that and they gave me the wrong slice of cake... very disappointed. The pizza was the only food item that didn't suck entirely. It was very thin but tasted okay. Definitely wouldn't go back ever again. Not worth the trip, or the hype.",1 star,1,0

Pros: any location Im at from Shenzhen China to Hawaii to Orlando I can count on McDonalds when I land. They keep the same consistent taste world wide. as a business owner this is admirable. This location was efficient and fast.

Cons: we all know it's not the healthiest food but that had nothing to do with the location

"This was a quick stop for a bite to tide us over with my a couple of the kids with us. We went thru the drive thru and even though it was slow business, we were put off to wait a couple of minutes and the assistant that took the order was very crisp and short in his interaction.He stated the price and told us to pay at the window where we were completely ignored for another several minutes while he (I'm assuming) took the order for the people behind us. When he finally took our payment and we moved forward to the window to receive our order, only half of the order was correct, and none of the condiments we requested were included. That kept us trying to get it sorted.
As a supervisor and a manager, I would hope review for management as well as employees could be considered in improving the atmosphere. It will be a place I will think twice before visiting again.

"For one usually it's only for coffee and to get away from the office as I stopped eating McDonald's food. The problem I faced recently was a homeless person who walked up to me and asked for 2 dollars for bus fare. When the bus stop is like 2 to three blocks down the road. I said I will buy you something to eat or drink but not give money. So,  for folks or tourists who get folks coming to them asking for money I suggest trying to offer food to them is more important then money. One thing about DC is there is alot of resources for folks who need money for bus fare or anything can find. Food too they know where to go. It's up to them to make that move. Another major situation I noticed is the McDonald's need some updating. I might know why they keep it so dull looking because McDonald's operates with the homeless so I guess they don't want to make it too comfortable. I been to much better ones who got nice and cool lounge chairs couches and OMG this one just looks ragged.",2 stars,2,0

They need to hire real English speakers. It took me 10+ minutes to explain my order. Then my fries were so cold they must have prepared them last night. I had to go back inside and wait another 10 minutes to get them replaced. Meanwhile my burgers were getting cold. There were 2 Mexicans ladies working the front and drive thru who seamed to be conversing and unbothered by THE customers in the lobby. The Mexican man in the back was the only one working hard. I don't know if anyone else was English speakers or not but all I saw was 4-5 Mexicans working at noon. Photos included.

I let the associate know it wasn't correct. He had me pull up to the wait window to get my correct food. As I sat and waited time was just ticking by. After 15 minutes of patiently waiting I wanted my food. No one came back. I knocked on the glass and no response. As about the 10th car received there food at the window behind me I had to get out of the car and walk back to that window as it was late and the inside was closed. I asked where my food was and he said he was making it. I asked for a refund and was given my slip refund a total of 28 minutes after first paying. I went back in the next day to speak with a manager to let them know that this happened. I had my receipt with the time and the refund receipt with the time 28 minutes later.

Service at THIS McDonald's is excellent and everyone that I interacted with was friendly and helpful.  The food actually looked like the advertising and tasted good.  I was so impressed that I asked for the manager so I could thank him and compliment his crew.  I truly believe that managers affect everything about their restaurant,  for  good or bad. Happy, respected employees who feel properly valued always reflect that in their interactions with customers and you could see that this manager was a leader of a team and not just the boss!

"For workers like her big companies' name are ashamed.

What a horrific experience I just had;  this lady you see in the picture for telling her she was giving me a wrong item and not the one I paid for she started a big drama and spilt my son's smoothie and started singing a vulgar song/lyrics as per offending me through that and not directly addressed to me. All that in front of the manager ..

Besides that waiting time was ridiculous long with a lot of customers not satisfied and even a uber eats guy had to cancel in front of  me because they didn't make his order in more than 20 min that I was there ...

Another lady in the back was not using the yellow paper that sandwiches have she was placing the  buns/bread directly on the table as she was preparing food for dogs. She saw me and start acting like nothing happened..

"We are staying at the hotel next door. My husband checks online to make sure the restaurant and dining room are open. They are. He walks over and the doors are locked. Walks back to the hotel, takes his car through the drive through, sits for 10 minutes and receives no service although there were employees in the restaurant. He sees other cars trying to receive service but they are all being ignored. He comes back to the hotel and calls again, at least 6 times, each time it says the number is disconnected even though he had already confirmed they were open through the same number earlier. Finally someone answers the call, he asks if they are open and they said no, he asked them why they answered the phone and were in the restaurant at 1am if it is closed, they said because their job is just to answer the phone. Its clear that the employees wanted to get paid for working all night without serving any customers. My husband used to work in fast food, and I wanted to believe that the stereotypes of McDonalds employees being terrible people and workers to not be true, but this location makes the company look bad. McDonald's should fire the franchise owner, or shut this location down, because they clearly dont know how to hire dependable employees.",1 star,1,0

"really this is a 4.5 star review. this McDonald's is located downtown salt lake city and everyone who lives here knows that parking downtown is almost impossible sometimes. Now mind you this parking lot is massive for McDonald's. way bigger than what the store needs. so people try to take advantage of McDonald's by parking here and going elsewhere.

For those idiots that are crying about their car getting booted, they were obviously trying to take advantage - even if they were McDonald's customers. There's signs posted all over that are plain as day stating 30 minute parking only otherwise subject to getting booted or towed.  the sign also blatantly says DO NOT LEAVE THESE PREMISES WITHOUT YOUR VEHICLE. so for everyone else crying, try reading the freaking sign. You know those metal signs cost money and they weren't custom made for entertainment or cosmetic purposes. use your brains......

This results in all customers having to wait until one of the kitchen staff happens to notice the customers standing at the counter, wishing to place their orders.  The expressions on the faces of the kitchen staff makes it clear that they are irritated at having to interrupt their own work to go over and take customer orders.  This situation has not been corrected for over 6 months, resulting in annoying wait times at what is supposed to be a fast food restaurant.  Hire more staff!!!",3 stars,3,0

"If you're turning left into the parking lot, it's a pain due to traffic blocking entrance. Employee at drive thru asked us to pull over to the side to wait for our order but since there was already a car there, she said we need to go to the otherside.. that means we have to pull out and turn back in. It was already a pain to get in the first place and now we have to do it again? My husband refused and said we'll just wait right there at the window. Need to come up with a better system than that!

It tasted like instead of coffee mixture it was blended with old filtered out deposits, I mean really sour.

Any way this place I gave it a 5 cause the employees are very respectful  clean when you oder there's a couple of employee's that I like to mention. Mr. Noe is a young man that does almost everything behind the counter very respectful fast worker is important in a fast food business. Next  Rosalva  is also a very respectful employee she works behind the counter greets you with a real smile not only welcome to McDonald's and a fake smile you could tell the difference ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Third is the one that runs this place is the manager Maria.

Then there is no drink station upstairs so with an already full tray, i had to bring food up and then come down for drinks. So why did i have to pick a flavor if the only deliver an empty?

The chicken sandwich was not hot either  and worse , it was waaaay overly smeared  with unhealthy  mayo which  I threw away so as to not suffer food poisoning.

I ask that your strength will be made perfect in our weakness. In Jesus's name, amen",5 stars,5,1

I visited the premises on 5th July 2018 at 8.45am Seriously McDonalds...you need to close this branch down...you cannot continue to offer service this bad under your company logo.

I tell the worker I didn't get a receipt and he says ""don't worry we will bring it out."" I dutifully sit down with my table number with my family and wait. I really wanted my receipt, and, as you can imagine, this will be important later.

So we sit around for a while, I go and ask for ketchup, cream, and sugar.  Get like 4 ketchup packs for 4 people's orders.  Ketchup poor I make my way back to my disappointed family and dole out one ketchup each.

More waiting, finally I go up with my table number and ask about the order.  The same worker looks at me and says ""do you have a receipt?""

"I would have given 5 stars but, the lady (MNGR) that took my order got one item wrong & I did not notice until I was long gone! Also, the COVID headache is pretty much behind us but, for some odd reason this location still has a limited/restricted dining room, even to the point of closing it down completely at 3:00pm everyday! I can understand being cautious & prepared but, to use the pandemic as a way to justify limiting/restricting areas of an establishment  that we as patrons normally use on any normal/regular day is unprofessional, inconvenient & just a way for them to make it easier to keep clean & one less thing to be done when it comes to closing down for the night!
However, though this ranting & raving I am doing in this post, I still get good customer service there when I do go for a quick & easy meal! & Their drive thru is  conveniently open 24 hrours",4 stars,4,1

"If you are visiting this particular McDonald's you'll notice that you are very nearly in the middle of the strange no-man's (or woman's) land encompassing skid row and the new upwardly trendy lofts and shops that seek to define Download Los Angeles. This McDonald's manages to straddle this uncomfortable melange quite nicely. The inside of the restaurant was bright and clean. The counters looked new and the menu sign actually was orderly laid out with sensible photos next to the main items. I don't eat fast food often and the overhead menus always confuse me with ""super"" this and ""extra large"" that... I know that I am not getting the best price - ever. But this menu seemed far simpler, we ordered and our food was served quickly (with my special request done just right). We ate in and the table was clean as was the floor. It's true we were approached twice by people asking for money, but they were not intrusive and I had the feeling the manager and staff were well aware of who was in the restaurant and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all. The staff was so attentive that for the first time I actually filled out the online survey just to compliment them. That's quite a compliment in itself coming from me.",4 stars,4,1

I have had to complain to corporate, I have had to talk to a manager via email. Nothing has been done, they don't even want to give me a refund they merely offered me a coupon which they never gave me. It has been months since this had happened and there is still no resolution.

"This McDonald's usually ROCKS!
They can get thru a line that goes all the way to the highway in under 20 min.

Tonight,  there was no line. Also the inside was closed. AND...  THE ICE CREAM MACHINE WAS BROKEN/SHUT OFF. SHOCKER.

My son did something amazing at school and wanted a Sunday for a treat. So thats why we went.

Then they didn't put all the things we ordered in the bag and we drove off. 2 u turns in traffic and waiting in line now to get what they forgot.
So... I asked the manager if they could just add a small bag of fries since we had to do 2 uturns to get this item they forgot to put in the bag. She said No, we can't do that.
REALLY!?!?!?! I have worked in the food industry for 28 years.  I am well aware of what you can and can not do.
You didn't WANT TO. You didn't want to value me as a person, a customer,  or a future. You didn't want to do your job properly in the 1st place. You didn't want to apologize in any way shape or form.

I don't mind that a mistake was made. I do mind that they acted like it was my fault for ordering anything to begin with.

I came into the store and bought my dinner at 9pm.  I sit there for 1 hour and then the staff came to me and asked me to leave. I thought that the store might be closing so I left. However, after I came out, I noticed that this is a 24 hour store. I bought food and no one else was waiting for a table. There was no reason for letting me out. The staff was rude!!!",1 star,1,0

"A worker called MY order number so obviously I'm gonna grab it. It didn't even occur to me to look at the tray the only thing I noticed was that I was missing a coffee so I set the tray on the table and on my way back I see the manager yelling at my family about how WE grabbed the wrong order and see at first we tried being cool about it. She said she was taking back the extra food and we said that was fine so then she starts grabbing the food we ordered and says we weren't charged for that, after an interesting conversation we establish that my receipt clearly said I was charged. Ten minutes later they've manned to give two BIG orders but haven't managed to give me a bacon egg mcgriddle. So eventually I get the burger and as the manager hands it to me she's telling a worker she gave us 8 hash browns. I obviously heard her and said ""no ma'am, we got 4"" this same manager then has the audacity to say we already ate them. At this point I'm pissed. I've been accused of not paying for my part of the food, I'm hungry, I've waited way too long, the manager has an attitude, AND she's a accusing my family of eating 4 hash browns in less than a minute. NEVER eating at this McDonald's again. Especially with a manager like that.",1 star,1,0

He said the owner do the hiring and it is not his fault. 1. Bad choice of words. 2. They may need to not be a 24 hour McDonald's 3. Hire appropriate staff.
I was taken back be the unprofessionalism I was handed. And charged $2 for a small order of fries.  SMH. I am glad that my mood was good.

#3 there is no where in the store an area where you can grab napkins, or ketchup, or straws. You have to go up to the counter and ask them for packets and straws and utensils, during lunch time when lines are longer and it's getting congested at the counter, it makes it worse when people have to constantly come up to the counter and ask for something.

I know itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not going to the gourmet but better than waiting at an untested restaurant for more expensive and worse food.

Shrink-flation at its best.  Half filled fries. Soda with no refills. Seriously? Especially now that a combo meal costs $9.

At first I thought it was because the restaurant was newer but after looking at these review",1 star,1,0

"One of the dirtiest, worst McDonalds in the city. Absolutely abysmal wait times, overworked/understaffed workers, HORRIBLE manager.

"Fire these two employees. I Came in today (3--12-17) through the drive through and I have not so good hearing. I was able to capture their horrible attitude of the manager (picured in white) that claimed ""What?, I told you there is only breakfast"". Trying to make things easier, I asked if the inside was open and I was shouted with a ""yes"". I reversed and parked into one of the empty parking spots. Then me and my 4 other guests walked inside. Took a tremendous amount of time for either one of the employees (Both pictured) to come and assist us as they were just laughing and talking amongst themselves. I was first to order and I was treated with ""I told you there was only breakfast, whomever it was that went through drive through."" I was disgusted with the horrendous treatment I received by the manager (Pictured in white). I'm sorry you hate your job, but that is no way to treat a customer. I was very polite, even though I was very upset about the service. The manager (Pictured in white should be fired) was so rude and acted as if he hated his job. The other employee (Pictured) was very rude as well as she tossed our food into the bag and threw it onto the counter for us to pickup. I was very upset at the horrible service we received. I don't know if it had anything to do with our race, but I did not want to go that route. Corporate please, read this and fire these two employees as they are harming your business  HORRIBLE SERVICE! DO NOT COME HERE UNLESS YOU WANT RUDE AND HORRIBLE SERVICE.",1 star,1,0

"Although conveniently located to several hotels, the hour wait to get my order shows incapability to handle the extra patronage. They are not adequately staffed to handle the extra flow of being centrally located. Even when we were at the window, it seems they were still scrambling to put our order together. Once back the hotel, we discovered that one of our orders was wrong! They placed bacon on one of the fish sandwiches!",1 star,1,0

"Manager on duty Ignacio extremely hostile and rude. I am an Uber driver and I have visited this location two weekends in a row. It is a very busy location on Saturday evenings. On my first visit I went to the drive-thru and ordered $10 worth of food and then parked and ran inside to ask to use the restroom he told me I had to pay a quarter. I then explain to him that I just had come through the drive-thru and I was a customer he said oh well.. you have to pay a quarter. On my second visit one week later I walked in ordered a coffee and politely asked him for a token for the restroom, Ignacio appeared to become upset by my request so much so, that he actually tossed it at me hard enough for it to bounce off the counter and land on the floor. He did not apologize...he just walked off.I feel he should be reprimanded for his blatant disrespect and rude Behavior towards paying customers. If this location is too much for him to handle maybe he should transfer somewhere else. I will never return to this McDonald's again as long as the manager Ignacio is in charge.",1 star,1,0
