Parking lot is crowded and road construction nearby is making it worse.  Good service,3 stars,3,0
"Staff were arguing amongst themselves whether who does what. Managers were indifferent to employees and with customers. Ordered two Happy Meals and a McFlurry and about 6 customers after I ordered, received their orders before me. We waited around 20 minutes or more. The McFlurry was supposed to be the Stroopwafel and there was hardly any in it, it was 99% vanilla ice cream.",2 stars,2,0

Best experience ever. The food was shockingly good. I did pizza and build your own pasta. Customer service was phenomenal.  Restaurant was very clean and we didn't wait long on our food. Can't wait to visit again.,5 stars,5,1
"Horrible!! It's cool that this McDonald's is a 24hr restaurant, BUT it's almost midnight with only one other customer and here I am, still waiting over 20+ minutes now!?? How slow can they be!? I can see 4 workers in here but that still don't explain this wait! These workers' sense of urgency is not there at all... Not even moving with any purpose! Maybe that is JUST the ""night""... So I hope.",1 star,1,0

If I was rating this on speed of service it would be negative stars but the food was good once we got it. This location is extremely busy and feels under staffed for the amount of business they get. What is the point of all the kiosks and a double lane drive through if it overwhelms the staff and you wait for 30-40 minutes for a 10pc mcnugget meal?,3 stars,3,0
I was just there this morning; to order a couple meals to go ; the word is TO GO right? Okay so we order and tell me why my food was wrong and I didn't get my iced coffee ?And when the cashier asked if it were for here or to go; I said to go. Hmm they always mess up orders and nevertheless get them right; the floors are always sticky and dirty as well some tables no where to really sit. Bad to come here,1 star,1,0

"Don't eat here! Order is always wrong, takes forever, fries are cold and gross. Dining room ""closes"" at 11pm. NOPE! Really closes at like 8pm. Update the hours on your door!!! When we knocked on the door and pointed to the sign, THE MANAGER FLIPPED US OFF!

At this same moment another came up and asked about the sundaes for his family that he ordered 20 minutes prior. I was given a refund without fuss before leaving.

I've never seen a McDonalds that serves pizza and pasta and has an arcade. The upstairs where the kids' playground and the arcade were was SO HOT. It was probably borderline unsafe for how hot it was for being inside the building. Especially since the kid's playplace was up there.

I left to get a wine then grab something from Mcdonalds as well since i was hungry. However, on my way to  liquor store an old man told me to go back grab my car since it will be booted. It already had been booteed ONLY 3-4 mins later when i ran back.

"Got two Filet-O-Fish sandwiches.  Both were good as expected.  I ordered through the McDonald's app and opted to pickup my sandwiches at the drive thru.  I told the employee at the speaker that I had an app order to pickup and gave her the code.  She instructed me to go to the first window.  There I was given the receipt, thanked, and told to go to the next window.  At the 2nd window I was told to go to a 3rd window to pickup the order.  The 3rd window is kind of funny, since it seems like an afterthought.

"To be honest, I usually frequent this local Santa Monica Micky D's for its coffee. I have to wake up pretty early, so a nice jolt of caffeine helps me start the day at 5am. With that being said, I will also say that because of Santa Monica's influx of homelessness over the years, this particular location gets alot of homeless patrons. Most are nice, and I buy some of the regulars a thing or two from time to time; however, it's the aggressive homeless patrons that make the place feel troublesome. The staff tries to placate situations, but you can tell they are getting frustrated more and more everyday.

I came here on my way to a meeting in the convention center. I had 20 minutes to be where I needed to be so I figured I would swing by this McDonald's and grab some food. Boy was that a mistake. I arrived at this McDonald's at 11:45. I did not order my food at the drive-thru window until 10 minutes after 12:00. By the time I actually got my food it was closer to 12:30. This has to be the absolute slowest McDonald's in the history of any restaurant in the world. It has double drive throughs and they seem to prefer the inside Lane to the outside lane. They were taking the orders of customers on the inside line too if not three to one. Not exactly sure what was going on inside the building. But they were slower than molasses. I understand that there is issues right now with finding employees for a little bit of prep work would have sped up the process a little bit. That's why I gave them three stars instead of one.,3 stars,3,0

We arrived there at 10:53 they close at 11, I know it's tabu to show up at a restaurant right before close, but we were 6 hours away from home and hungry.

I'm not usually one to complain about things because I do realize this is a fast food restaurant, however this last visit has really ticked me off, I couldn't even place my order because the person taking orders in the drive thru was so incompetent, and then she wanted to act like she couldn't hear me. Other times I have visited this location,  I have had an issue where items were left off my order, so brought the food back to have it all replaced because by the time I got home and had to drive back to pick up my missing items, it would all be cold.

I Checked my receipt to confirm that my sandwich should gave had the artisan bun, proceeded to the counter  to correct the problem with my order to be told tgey were out of artisan buns. I was pissed and walked off. I finished my meal, went to refill my drink and spoke with a man in yellow shirt and tie behind the counter about how terrible that the one woman knew there were no artisan buns but the order taker at the register knew nothing about it as well as the girl who gave me my food. Someone should have confirmed that the sesame seed bun would meet my approval. And I notified him this kind of service was not indicative pf McDonald's and that I would be callong corporate. The following day I contacted McDonald's corporate who passed on my complaint to the restaurant location. I received a call from Rose who apologized for the problem with the order and asked that I come back and give them the opportunity to make tge meal properly per my request. I stopped in on Friday January 26th and Emma made sure that the meal was prepared to the standards I believe McDonald's is known. The sandwich was flavorful with the artisan roll and the fries were hot and fresh. Thanks so much for taking the initiative to prepare my meal to the high quality McDonald's is known to deliver.",3 stars,3,0

"This McDonald's screws up 96% of the time! Tonight was the last straw. My husband ordered 2 large fries, 2 PLAIN McChickens, and 2 large drinks.....The drinks were great.....the rest was not even what he ordered and OLD. In the bag was a fillet o fish (which to my surprise was the only fresh thing), 2 medium 5 year old fries, and 2- 10 year old cheeseburgers...seriously, the cheeseburgers were so old the cheese was crusting. Where is the quality????? They don't care if people are upset and/or get food poisoning?? Granted my husband should have checked the bag before leaving, but he didn't think to (not surprised). I was definitely upset the order was wrong and said whatever and we were going to eat it because we basically got smaller fries, but an extra sandwich, but those CHEESEBURGERS were so horrendous that whoever put that order together should be fired because it was just wrong..meat and cheese was well past shelf life and the pics I upload will show it.

This McDonald's is way more efficient than the other McDonald's down by  Animal Kingdom with the drive thru they are also a lot more friendlier at least on the intercom. But they didn't cook my quarter pounder to temp because it was still red on the inside of the meat which was disgusting. I had to go to the door in order to get my burger fixed which then I ran into the situation of them starting to close their doors 5 minutes before they were supposed to close at 12 and the employee looked at me and said we are closed when I literally was holding the burger in my hand to show for proof. I look at the employee and say I know I came up here because I had just ordered from the drive thru this burger and it isn't cooked all the way. She takes the burger doesn't say anything and shuts the door with me standing outside. I then wait thank gosh she came back with a new one I didn't know if she was going to.

Pros: any location Im at from Shenzhen China to Hawaii to Orlando I can count on McDonalds when I land. They keep the same consistent taste world wide. as a business owner this is admirable. This location was efficient and fast.

Cons: we all know it's not the healthiest food but that had nothing to do with the location
So I only ate it once on my 5 day stay.
McDonald's should explore healthier options for the current market . But still a great experience

"Another experience.

I was asked to wait at drive thru. No other customers were in queue. They forgot about me. The order was reduced without telling me. The apple pies were removed without any explanation. When I called to report the issue a woman who answered the phone saying she was the manager didn't identify herself. She was rude and short and when I asked for her name she wouldn't provide it. Bad experience with the food too. The fries were so over salted I couldn't eat them and the big mac had so much lettuce and sauce on it I was wondering what happened in the kitchen. End to end bad experience.

Hello I came to your restaurant this morning and waited an extremely long time and was ignored by your staff. I waited at the drive thru order kiosk, then at the payment window and then at the pick up window. Your staff saw me waiting making eye contact several times but continuing to ignore me. I moved back to the payment window and waited while several cars pulled up waiting too. When Mitzy who had ignored me finally opened the window was really dismissive with her demeanor before taking my order. I asked why she saw me and continued to make me wait. Her response was I just put on the headset. Seriously that was her response. There were at least four of the staff who saw me so I am really frustrated with your customer service. Why didn't she acknowledge that she kept me waiting and just apologized for the delay like a normal person. I was really offended that she was so flippant when I asked her about making me wait. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and lack of basic human kindness. NOT LOVING IT.

Visited again on 3/17/2018 and had the same experience. Even the white shirt manager ignored me.",1 star,1,0
Staff that is both courteous and knowledgeable.  Food always tastes fresh. I like that they have two ordering stations so that you can still enter and exit as quickly as feasible even during busy times.

It's 1230 in the morning, no line and the kid working says it's going to take an hour.  When I knownfor a fact it takes about 10 to 15 min. I had placed an order on the app using my free points. Looking to get a quick bite on my Sunday night walk home from my usual business and now I'm down from 2600 points to 100 points...AND STILL HUNGARY!!!! Yall lucky you get a 2 star.. update I now have 1600 points O.o. yall need to properly train your staff and quite frankly I think you should just overhaul the entire place with new staff because what you have now..SUX!",2 stars,2,0

Then it happened again, & I was able to see the staff member put the she retrieved from previous customer to the side. When I got to the window for my pickup, she wanted me to take that bag.

"The only reason that I stoped to buy at McDonald's was because of my youngest daughter. But what we experienced today put an end to it. The employees at this location did not maintain an order serving  customers in the drive thru area. As you noticed, there are two lines in the drive thru and they are supposedly serve in a first come first serve basis but that was not the case. The associate, instead of been polite, talked to us in a not too pleasant tone. I did not wanted to make things worst so we placed our order and moved on to pay and pick up. Luckily the manager was close by and had the opportunity to address the experience. I hope they take this opportunity to improve their customer service skills and provide customers a much pleasant experience.",2 stars,2,0

"I realize this is a REALLY BIG and REALLY POPULAR location, because it is unique... My friend and I were only in town for a few days, and this is something we wanted to experience.

While there we figured that we would order something, so we both got a dessert item, my friend got a McFlurry, and I got a Hard Ice Cream in a Waffle Cone.

We ordered from the self serve kiosk, for some reason the one we were at was not accepting payment, not sure if the others were broken too? So I went to the one counter that had an Employee and paid there, since it was Ice Cream I was told that it would be available at the Ice Cream counter, which made sense, since that's where the Hard Ice Cream was.

My friend and I waited quite awhile for a Staff Member to notice us standing there, I say notice us, since some came close, but never looked over at us... When one finally did I flagged her down, she told us that she ""has not be told to come here"" then walked away!?!

So, I went to the main counter, as I approached my number was being called from the main counter, so I guess the Ice Cream counter was not the pick up location? Ahh, the McFlurry came from the main counter, but the Hard Ice Cream was coming from the Ice Cream counter... sure, that makes sense I suppose?

I head back over to the Ice Cream Counter, and guess who reluctantly appears? The young Female Employee who was now told to come over to serve me... she DID NOT look impressed to be there! After fighting with the sliding glass doors that cover the Hard Ice Cream for several minutes, she finally got them open, I had to point out the Rocky Road Ice Cream, one small scoop was placed on the Waffle Cone, and I was sent on my way... I'm not sure what it was supposed to look like, since on the Kiosk, it only shows an empty Waffle Cone with no option of its contents.

It was an interesting place, but based on this one visit, I would likely not return unless it was much less busy.",3 stars,3,0

"I awoke one morning from a dream. Wiping the sweat from my brow, I tried to recall the details. ""Table service at MacDonald's"" I heard my self say aloud. I picked up my phone to find my dream a reality: MacDonald's had implemented technology allowing them to bring my order to me at the table. I could order on the kiosk, take a locator, and lo and behold, my order would appear before my very eyes. It was as if God himself had given me a glimpse of creation.

I sprung from my abode and ran on all fours to MacDonald's as quickly as possible, as if reality itself would evaporate before I got there. I arrived, breath short and mouth whet,   and began the final steps of my journey. My finger met the kiosk screen like lovers separated by the ocean reuniting.

I got my usual, a cheeseburger with no bun or patty, and sat patiently, gripping my locator  like the staff of Moses. The number seven sat abreast my locator -- the day God rested. ""I too would rest,"" I exclaimed aloud, ""when my journey meets it's end, as my food meets my table.""

But in the next instant, I was met with a fate worse than Gob's a thousand fold -- they called out my order from the counter and didn't bring it out to me.

My faith was shattered that day. Never again shall the thought of joy haunt my mind. Never again shall true happiness be known.",1 star,1,0

Ordered several meals and customized my Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich meal to include bacon, pickles, and cheese, and a large fry. Service was great for me.

Service-0 of 10 (did kiosk order, and waited 29 minutes for my order after being told by 1 employee my number wasn't ready as it sat there and I saw it. Manager looked at me/over me 3x before asking me what number I was. Then a lady came from the back of the kitchen and helped me as best she could.

"TLDR: You can get the BTS meal here - two sauces and special bag included.

Never thought I'd be writing a review for a McDonald's, yet here we are. Was disappointed to hear that the purple packaging isn't available in the U.S. (@Corporate: missed opportunity!). Hesitant because the paper bag adorned with the BTS logo was not guaranteed to be available at all locations. Fears were quelled, as I saw other guests sitting outside, and the elusive BTS paper bag going for $70+ on eBay was elusive no longer. Utilized the self-service machines to order - quick and easy. Medium and large sizes available (opted for medium, which was more than enough food in hindsight). Liked the Cajun sauce more than the Sweet Chili sauce, but just a personal preference. Total of the medium BTS meal was $8.39 + 0.74 tax = $9.13. Food was nothing special; just happy to support the boys.

As always, please be kind to food service workers.

Than waited well over 5 mins then to pay and there was only 1 car besides me in line and they waited a while to pay as well.  Then to not get my order properly made and then was told my order was made correctly and that next time I would be charged extra for what they had to do, which was to make my order right !

I asked for a macchiato.  Got a large cup of sugar and cream WITH A SQUIRT OF ESPRESSO. I wanted macchiato not a cup of creamer and sugar. I asked for more espresso to be added and got attitude about it and was told they would have to charge me more next time FOR THE ESPRESSO! They clearly do not realize what an macchiato is! It has espresso in it and not just a 7th of cup of espresso! Manager was not helpful. Said that's the way its made. I said no its not. I've been to many other McDonald's and this isn't how they make it. I also have had this at a lot of other coffee places and that what they gave me wasn't a macchiato. He said I work at 3 other McDonald's no its not. So I told him which one I like to go to that makes it right. So then he proceeds to say we'll that is how our machine makes it. Didn't want to help. Just argue and get rid of me. I didn't appreciate being treated like I was and that I would be charged for wanting espresso in my drink that is supposed to have espresso!

The funny thing is that there's usually someone inside to tell me that they're closed.. I don't mind that they close early, but they need to correct their hours if that's the case. I frequently get off work rather late and I'm usually pretty hungry, I can go somewhere else but this location ~would~ be convenient for me for how close it is to my work.

I'm sorry but I paid a lot for my order to begin with, I'm not excepting burnt fries, especially three days in a row. Each time I asked for some new fries, and then they would give me good fries that were not burnt. Except for yesterday, I got my money back.  I ask the girl why was she giving me burnt fries, and her reply was that they didn't change the oil in which they cooked the fries in. The point is as a customer you don't have to keep excepting burnt fries, or anything that doesn't look right to you. You are already spending so much money to begin with ,to be getting burnt fries.

McDonald's has been around since the dark ages it seems and they have always been a pretty good place to enjoy fast food. But lately the food hasn't improved any but the prices have skyrocketed and I refuse to go there anymore for what you pay for their meals you could dine out someplace with a lot more ambiance and social attractiveness.,3 stars,3,0

Some of the negative reviews I'm seeing might be for other I-Drive locations. This one on the south end located near Sea World is always pretty good. It's a well run establishment and seems a little more upscale than the others in the area. Service is friendly although a bit on the slow side on my most recent visit but the Drive Thru was packed as this was on a Saturday night during a busy time of season in Orlando.,5 stars,5,1

This place has the worst service they kept giving us the wrong order and actually had his pay for someone else's. the area took a while to correct and then we still had to wait for our food for another 10 minutes or so.

What
I thought id have to check out the biggest play area at a McDonalds.. I actually have lived in Orlando for over 15 years and today was the first time I went. Upon reading some review, I just realized it is the largest... and an actual tourist attraction... I took a toddler her to play and BOY what an experience.

Environment
This is right off a busy intersection, i-Drive and sand lake. The parking can get packed.. The building is huge! You cannot miss it. It is 2 stories and the play area is quite big as well, with an arcade inside. There are 2 stories, you enter the play area on level 2. You order the food downstairs and you can sit upstairs. There are a lot of self ordering machines so it makes ordering go a little faster? Upstairs was VERY HOT! Like there was no AC... and when you walk downstairs it was cool.

Niceness of the staff
Barely had any interactions with the staff. It was ok.

Dollar
They also sell pizza, and that was ok... it starts at $9 and every topping is at least $1

Yes?

The line on the drive through is very slow and long. So i decided to go inside. It is friday night. On the door states lobby open untill 12am. They have the doors locked and guys dancing and clowning around. One of them opens the door and tells me they can not take orders in the lobby that drive through is the only way. I asked him may i speak to the shift manager. So he went off and came with one of the guys. Not the manager. He said that the owner of the McDonald's closes early.

"This plave is not a good place. They used to have blacks there too. Now all hispanic and trey just remodeled. All of sudden after the remodel all the staff all like the same race. I though McDonald's was equal opportunity employer. Guess not. Today I went there to use the restroom. I was told I couldn't use the restroom unless I bought something. I explained that it was an emergency and I just have to take a number one and I will be on my way. I asked to speak to the manager, the manager told me the same thing you have to buy something. I told the manager I really had to use the restroom it was an emergency I'll be in and out that's all I need it and I was still denied. Every time I come to this place is always something. Things to give me cold food all the time I would ask for fresh food and they would make me wait 20 to 30 minutes I would just wait while standing there looking at her. I wasn't really strong with expressing myself oh, now I express myself a little bit more. I just thought that everybody should know is this place really isn't a nice place to be I wouldn't give them a dime of my money. When did they treat people and I've always treated people is not okay if I was a business owner in a McDonald's along to me I would fire the entire staff shut the McDonald's down and start new with the whole new staff of all Races and ethnicities different religions in different ways of being themselves instead of running it like Fort Knox and no one even speaks English. Not a respectable place and I think a lot of changes need to happen. The last thing that we all need is a petition being signed to shutdown a very nasty, disrespectful, unprofessional in very unreliable restaurant in one of the most popular places in California. Let's get back together McDonald's or else I'll go to the next level and bringing all these customers that also it's like this McDonald's. We even go one more step above and bring the in all your future customers who have never been there before just to mention on how they've had experiences at McDonald's that were so exceptionally great and then compare it to the way that you treat all the customers who've walked out of McDonald's and see if they'll never come back I don't think we want this to be a topic of discussion.",1 star,1,0

I like that they have other food besides the regular burgers. was impressed by the brick oven pizzas they were putting together. we tried ordering breakfast (ALL DAY) but they were out of so many entrees... like OUT! not sure how you run the world's biggest McD's and not have stuff on hand at 2.30 in the afternoon. It wasn't super crowded. Love the self-ordering kiosk (that's what you get for demanding $15/hr for fast food wages). Love even more that you can order from your app and just go pick it up at the counter. Our fries were as expected from the golden arches.  the top floor has seating and an arcade.  the main floor has a lot of seating areas with plenty of window seating. for it being the world's biggest, it really didn't seem THAT big ... also, they could have more of a variety of entrees / foods / dishes that is different from a regular neighborhood mcd's - just a thought.",4 stars,4,1

"Convenient to the east end of Kalakaua Ave. Long line in the morning for breakfast. Staff friendly and they can/will deliver to your table--which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. Complaints: homeless person racked out at one of the tables; some tables smelled  (my 4-yr-old granddaughter asked me if we could move). Nonetheless, that was just one area so if you gotta go to McDonald's while visiting this end of Waikiki, it's a good choice. Picky's Tip: there are self serve kiosks up near counter. So if in long line, check them out--for some reason people were not using them. Saved at least 15 minutes and that's how you get table delivery.",4 stars,4,1

"The food was McDonald's typical. I like the new design, but as many of them I've been to lately are, it was just filthy. I was there for over an hour and a half letting my kids eat and play and not once did I see anyone clean a table or anything off the floor. It would also be helpful for there to be napkins in the play area so you could clean up messes without leaving your kids or taking the whole crew with you.",3 stars,3,0

They moved the slowest I've ever seen a human move, the were lethargic and made it clear they couldn't care less. All of them! Out of two orders, they got both wrong. It's a testament to McDonald's that their general standards are so high, across the world in my experience, that this terrible restaurant stands out as an exception. Whoever does their quality audits needs sacking, or spend more time there.",1 star,1,0

I had a bad experience here.  My son who is autistic had to use the restroom really bad.  He bolted in the women's restroom when a lady came out.  I was confronted by the security guard in an angry manner.  He said I had to buy something before using the restroom and said my son couldn't use the women's bathroom. I attempted to explain to him that my son is special needs and did not understand the symbols on the restroom door.  He argued with me and wouldn't shut his mouth.  Before I left I  bought a meal for each member of my family.  While waiting for our meal he stared at me like if he wanted some trouble.  I explained to him that it's frustrating when people can't see the situation parents with special needs go through.  I apologized to him for getting angry and made him aware of the treatment we get at some establishments.  Hopefully he learned a little about how to understand and deal with certain situations.,3 stars,3,0

"I want to apologize to anyone that I recommended this particular McDonald's to in the past.
This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks, but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly. At that time, it was worth it. The menu was cheap (or at least what you know to expect from a international chain) and, since it's a chain, you know what the food is gong to be like.
So, let's look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants. You need to set yourself apart with your service. This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant. Sadly, I don't think they care anymore. The last time we went, half of the kiosks weren't working. One of the three that was, didn't print receipts. (This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious. Actually there was a lot that played into it.) Now, if you've gone to McDonald's at all recently, you know you pick your food at the kiosk, get a number that you take to your table, pay at the kiosk, sit down and wait for your food. Typically all of that takes about five minutes. Well, this day (and what I've garnered from tourists and locals, on many other days) the team at work decided they weren't going to bring the food to the table. That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE, but of course that would have been a form of service so that didn't happen. After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together (only a slight exaggeration) we were told by other customers that were leaving that they weren't calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters.
Ok... So I go up to the counter and wait. We get our food 40 minutes later, and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected. No big deal, we are used to this.
My in-laws are visiting and at this point I'm trying to figure why they haven't received their order. It dawned on me  that my father in-law doesn't have a receipt (remember the machine that wasn't printing receipts?).
The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt, not the tent number. Apparently, my in-laws food was ready in a master of minutes (amazing since that is all customized) and placed in the ""abandoned order"" area. If we hadn't said anything, they would never have received their food. The lady never once called a tent number. We told another person of the lack of receipt problem. That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers. When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt, she asked us what the receipt number was. We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine, and she asked again for the receipt.
Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do, the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump. I'm not sure if they just didn't staff well on this shift, but like I said, I've talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while.",1 star,1,0

I have had to complain to corporate, I have had to talk to a manager via email. Nothing has been done, they don't even want to give me a refund they merely offered me a coupon which they never gave me. It has been months since this had happened and there is still no resolution.

1st...this Mc Donald's seemed to have their own guidlines for COVID-19. And the guidlines they followed were NONE or ZERO. The place was VERY crowded.NO social distancing. NO one to monitor or count how many people were allowed in. it  did not feel or look clean or a safe environment ...good to  spread germs and viruses.
alot of people from the street who were not customers just hanging around using many tables and  shoulder to shoulder in the seats. people passed out in the chairs with masks pulled off. They had ONE dining room person who just could not keep up with the mess that they were leaving. The bathroom was a horror show: obviously people were washing and cleaning more than just their hands inside. was dirty.
2nd,..the saving grace of the restaurant was the cashier, the food expediter and the employees making the food. they were all very fast, pleasant, thanked me, and the food was hot, fresh and very good.

They get an extra Star because their staff 8 of 10 have been polite. Drive through has issues. They constantly get order wrong. Ask you to pull forward to fix and leave you hanging. I have had to go in twice to see why I am still sitting after five minutes. They are new. I understand training new people. But when you place an order and they repeat it back correctly and it comes out wrong or you have to repeat 3 times to make sure they get it right. Someone inside needs to make sure they are reading the whole ticket. Not just a quarter pounder. Especially with the multi menu choice of adding bacon or lettuce and tomatoes. Their tea as of late has tasted like dish soap and their fountain drinks have a funky taste to them. Numerous times their fries have been under cooked.,2 stars,2,0

Of course, the kids can and will spend hours exploring the play area and arcade (a few of the games were out of order and not many prizes to choose from). The place was packed when we visited.

But what put this over the top was the employee's. 1 female worker came out screaming somebody stole $200 from her purse, then the manager acted like  she wasn't even there. Extremely wrong way to act or even pose as a manager. Then the Boyfriend came in of the victim employee and they called the cops on him because he demanded his girlfriend money to be rightfully returned. Meanwhile 2 other employee's stated that they had money stolen from the as well over the last few weeks. Definitely not a well run establishment or managed.

@McDonald's corporate you need to investigate this location immediately. The customer service is highly lacking and I'm positive the management of that location is damaging your brand. Not only is service extremely slow but the drive through service provider and the manager is horrible. We literally witnessed people driving away from the intercom after waiting and waiting with no response. We drove up to the intercom and waited and waited. Zero response. We spoke multiple times. No reaponse. No one greeted us. No one asked us to wait. Nothing. Radio silence. Then we dro e up to window only to face a combative manager with a chip on his shoulder. Needless to say we drove away without making an order. It was an experience that definitely does not live up to the world renowned brand standards of McDonald's.,1 star,1,0

They pay no mind to customers waiting in line to have their order taken even when it isn't even busy in the slightest. Sometime they don't give me my receipt. Sometime my order will be ready in the bag, but they'll set it aside, and realize it much later, as I watch them complete other orders wondering why mine is taking too long, and it turns out my order was read all along, they just never bother to call the number.

"TERRIBLE service. Stopped by this place 3 times at about 1am hour. First time the lady messed up my order so bad and when I asked her to correct it she still got it wrong. But hey...it was 1am I get it. Nope...came back a week later and this time the drive thru person couldn't understand English at all. I tried and tried to get her to understand my order and nothing. I have no problems with the language barrier but this was just unacceptable for a window worker. Third time was tonight. Got here early this time - they close at 9pm. It was 8:30 and doors were already locked inside and out. The worker just stood their ignoring everyone even though they are supposed to close 30 min from now.

In summary
1- untrained workers who either cant speak English/dont pay attention to orders
2- service takes FOREVER
3- lazy and disorganized workers who close way too early.

My issue came with the TWO managers that were ""taking care of the guests"". Zero communication to anyone about what the wait was about. I deduced that I was waiting for pies because I heard the crew talking about it. These 2 managers were more concerned about what they were doing later and how one typically doesn't work weekends.

"I had revise my earlier review, left underneath this new one.

Just had the most bizarre experience. The lady who took my money at the first window seemed to have a problem with me wanting my change back. She FOLLOWED me to the other window, and started harassing me BETWEEN the barriers meant to stop the spread of Covid 19. Multiple times she stuck her face between the windows to berate me. She asked me what else I was waiting for after I got my drink. As I had just given her my money, she shouldn't be handling my food at all, much less trying to talk to me and knew I had a burger. She then closed the window, and started throwing a coniption that I couldn't hear. The then reopened the windows, stuck her face between the barriers and told me she knew what I had ordered. I told her I didn't understand, and she shoved her face further out and repeated she knew what my order was again, closer and more loudly. I don't get it, I've been here many times and gotten my food without any problems. This young lady not only made the food leave a bad taste in my mouth, but she is exposing people to the potential life threatening virus for no reason. Very very poor attitude and dangerous actions because I wanted my change?

Great, they have really turned things around in the last couple years. The service used to be slow and highly inconsistent. These days, despite all the challenges the restaurant industry has faced they overcame whatever had been stopping them from providing the McDonald's Standard, fast food with correct orders. Not sure if they got new management, training, or equipment, but these guys have brought back the Gold (Arch) Standard. Great job team!",1 star,1,0

Finally the McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s were short handed and the drive thru line was big, and they were extremely slow and it took them 20 mi",1 star,1,0
"They accidentally gave my friends and I a whole order that we cancelled, and they also gave us the actual orders we bought. All in all they were pretty fast workers. They have to be because that place is always packed because of the Santa Monica Pier.

"I have been in line for 10 minutes and how you have it set up you have one line you veer to the right of the intercom or to the left but you only have one lane going to those intercoms. I had several people behind me this lady comes around and cuts me off. I got out of my car I said excuse me you almost hit me and could have caused a catastrophic accident . She said that the lady told her to cut in front of me and I said who and the manager of that McDonald's Sylvia said I did. I told her you almost caused a catastrophic accident and she said it's a two-lane and I said no ma'am and other people in line roll their windows down and said it's only a one lane and Sylvia argued with all of us that were  in line  waiting. You're going to have a catastrophic accident there if you don't get two lanes drawn up. Number two, Sylvia should not be arguing with the customers in line and she did not serve us. I never use profanity I told her it was unprofessional and that it could have caused an accident and other people were telling her the same.I'm very disappointed how McDonald's has lowered the bar in hiring people that will argue with their customers when the  are trying to prevent an accident. I thought the motto is safety first.",1 star,1,0

"With a 6 year old we visit McDonald's every so often..this place was just awful.

Ordered 20 regular mcnuggets a large fries, couple drinks and a happy meal.

45 min wait - 17 spicy nuggets in the boxes, no sauces despite the machine asking what sauces we want. Drinks are just cups, despite the machine asking what we want - self service downstairs with no instructions on how to get the milkshake we ordered as only soda fountains at the stations etc

Nuggets were over cooked, Like properly crunchy/jerky texture

Fries were literally stone cold, not even warm

Our kid loved the play centre but this isn't worth paying twice the price of a regular McDonald's for just plain terrible food and no service at all",1 star,1,0

"Tl;Dr poor service, frequently gets orders wrong.

We try and avoid this place even when we specifically have a hankering for McDonald's. We always have an issue at this McDonald's no matter what time of day,  whether we order from a food delivery service or in person. The orders always get screwed up,  from missing items to getting a sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle that just had cheese! If there was other fast food options besides pizza and halal nearby we'd probably never go here again.
But today I finally understood why it's a mess: there's no communication. It was a busy time since school had just let out and I stood for about 5 minutes waiting for a Dr. Pepper and watched the crew work in relative silence while pushing out food orders without tickets and without speaking to each other. Anyone who has worked in food service knows a quiet kitchen spells more trouble than a loud one. Eventually my sister flagged down the man doing drink orders and asked if the drink he'd just placed in the row of 8 other drinks he'd been setting down indiscriminately was our Dr. Pepper and he said yes...it was a Coke.
Management here really needs to have a talk to the crew about working together as a team and communication, especially when it's busy. Yes it's just a McDonald's, and I'm not expecting white glove service from a fast food joint, but our community deserves better than what we're getting for sure.",2 stars,2,0

The people working in the back only worked on drive thru orders. While waiting, we watched as they cleared our order off the monitor without having served it. At that point, I asked one of the employees why our order was cleared and he responded that he didn't realize it hadn't been served. We were the only people in the restaurant and we were clearly waiting at the counter for something, whether it was food or a condament or napkins and they never even bothered to ask what we needed or what we were waiting for.

"Went on a Thursday so it wasn't overwhelmingly busy but still busy enough that there were lines to the kiosks & people wandering to find a cash register employee. Wait time was not bad. Food came in probably 15 mins. We stayed downstairs to receive our trays at the counter, I could see how there would be an issue if you went upstairs to sit & waited for an employee to come find you. The girl who brought our food was very very nice! We received our pastas first even though we ordered the pizza first so I have a feeling it was just sauce pots sitting on warmers to dump quick dishes. Not sure why other comments say their pasta took long. Our pizza came out fine.

Their hash browns are hard as well, and there is so much grease that it runs down your fingers when you pick it up.

This place was so good we went back a second time they have pizza and pasta AND CAKE at McDonald's I rate this place one of the best McDonald's experiences ever don't forget they have a giant play area upstairs that is free as a giant Jungle Gym area and then your best bet is to pay the $5 for 30 minutes of arcade time and you got 30 minutes to play all the games you want,5 stars,5,1

So 4:20 in the morning obviously means something else to this McDonald's.  No coffee made up. The jerk at the window couldn't have been more rude and put off that we were there.  Today we were up early to start our long drive home after what was a very nice weekend in Salt Lake City.  If this is the impression McDonald's wants to leave the. I am happy to never frequent any of their establishments.  15 minutes from the time we paid til the we got our food in the drive through and two cars behind us got theirs ahead of us.

Well just because that McDonald's is on international drive which is in the tourist area doesn't give him the right to jack up their prices and I go up and down international drive quite a bit I drive charter buses and because their prices are jacked up so high I won't bring a busload of people there now the young lady that brought my lunch out you know she was very very friendly very nice young lady the restaurant is clean but your prices are way too high and until they come down I will not bring 50 60 people in my bus to that location just because you're on international drive don't mean you can rip people off and that's all you're doing when I can take them four miles down the road to a Burger King and their prices are a lot lot lower so if you want to start seeing more charter buses come in there with people lower your prices,3 stars,3,0

"My only visit to this shop and I witnessed these: 1) There were two lines but suddenly one of the staff members stopped taking orders and closed the point-of-sales machine.  Those customers on that line were told to go at the back of the other line.
2) I understand that some staff are new but the supervisor or senior staff are rude to the new staff and do not help train them.  I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t understand the yelling (probably because they are in Spanish).
3) Majority of staff speak Spanish and announce numbers in Spanish.  Expect some misunderstanding when they are taking your order too.  One of the staff put in hot coffee when I ordered hot coffee.
4) Be prepared to wait in a long line and always check your order before you leave the pick up counter.  It was my fault that I did not check/realize my Big Mac and South West salad dressing are missing when I felt.

He said 50 cents..it looked like a childs cone..he said you can pay 50 cents or take the cone..I kept insisting he remake it..he suggested to refund my money and I took it and went to Wendy's!! it was crazy how rude the manager and the staff were.

Strangely I almost always get skipped in line at this McD. I will pull up as the lone vehicle and another pulls up a minute later in the lane beside me and get immediate service. I am not sure if it's because my car is quiet or what but its mildly annoying. Never has my sauce order been correct. Never. Even when I pay for it. Even when I ask and confirm at the window.

"A Culinary Ode to McDonald's: The Epitome of Delicious and Affordable Dining

Never cease to amaze us with your consistently appetizing offerings, and your unwavering commitment to providing mouthwatering meals at unbeatable prices. A true beacon of fast-food excellence, McDonald's has reigned supreme for generations, and its legendary menu items have captured the hearts and taste buds of millions around the world.

One of the crowning jewels of McDonald's, their nuggets are nothing short of extraordinary. With a golden, crispy exterior and tender, juicy interior, these delectable nuggets are the epitome of culinary perfection. They are seasoned to perfection, giving each bite a harmonious blend of savory and flavorful goodness. It's no wonder that these little bites of heaven have become a staple in fast food history.

And let us not forget the piï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ce de rï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½sistance that is the Quarter Pounderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ld's dedication to providing affordable, high-quality dining experiences for all. Each bite of the Quarter Pounderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ boasts a succulent, juicy patty cooked to perfection, smothered in a tantalizing blend of cheese and crispy bacon. The mouthwatering aroma alone is enough to send my senses into overdrive.

Paired with a generous serving of their world-famous fries and a refreshing beverage, the Quarter Pounderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ with Cheese & Bacon meal is a steal at just $8.99. It's no exaggeration to say that McDonald's is making a significant charitable contribution to society by providing these scrumptious meals at such affordable prices. They are not just satisfying our hunger but also nourishing our souls with the joy and comfort that only their delicious food can bring.

So, to McDonald's, we raise our glasses (and our nuggets) in praise and admiration. Thank you for your unwavering dedication to quality, affordabilitynd the countless memories you've helped create around shared meals and moments of pure, palate-pleasing bliss.",5 stars,5,1
"042321 Tried them again in a rush and was insulted with a terrible attitude because I added a tea to my order, then she walked away with my credit card, the large cup had black finger prints marks on it, and gave me a scorched and cold egg Mcmuffin sandwich. The hashbrown was also greasy!

I ordered a bacon McGriddle w/o cheese, hash brown and a senior coffee. She thanked me and stated my cost. When it wasn't aligned with normal cost, I had to ask if I would do better ordering it as a meal. That reduced the price very nicely, but made me wonder why my server didn't at least offer to check the price to help me. Then, I decided if I'm paying for my cheese, I'll take it on the side. When I got my order, the bacon and the hash brown were just so loaded with grease! The sandwich was messier, sweet dough (yuk) and the hash brown soaked through the bag! I know McDonald's serves fast food, but this made me feel like a heart attack was going to happen if I ate it! I rarely stop at McD but I was running and hadn't eaten.

Another time the line wasn't that long but took a good 20 minutes to get through and when I got to the window to pick up my order they had more employees inside talking and chatting.

The Coke was ok, the fries like always (not full but fresh) and I got one sandwich with lettuce and one without. I told the kid in the front ""this sandwich has lettuce one it"" which prompted him to tell the guy and girl at the grill to please fix it... they shrugged their shoulders and pointed at the monitor and said ""well it only says one sandwich no lettuce...""

I mean come on guys. The kid at the register made an honest mistake and instead of going back and forth with him, just fix the dang sand which! Don't sit there and argue. So the guy in the back snatched the sand which and threw it! At that point I asked for a refund.. little did they know, I speak Spanish. So when the assistant manager asked me what happened I explained to her and she let out this LOOOONNGG sigh... so sorry I am an inconvenience to you, but if you were to train your team members some customer service this wouldn't have been an issue.

I eat at McDonalds about every 2-3 years.  I went in specifically for the boo pails and adult happy meal offer.  They did not have either offer even though they are advertised until 10/31.  I had a big Mac sandwich.  The 2 burger patties shrunk so much since I last had one 3 years ago.  They were literally burger chips.  Service was frieny and the restaurant was clean and decorated nicely.,3 stars,3,0

I said no McDonald's sloppy order taking is making me wait. I encourage everyone to not pull up out of the way when fast food restaurants screw up.

"This morning after ordering and paying for my food, I waited over 5 minutes in line to get my meal. I was in a rush to get to an appointment so I decided to call to see what was the hold up. Needless to say, the manager Ashleigh that answered the phone was 1. Very rude and 2. She hung up on me after I asked her to have the car in front of me pull up so I can get my meal and leave. When I got to the window, she not only disrespected me but she cursed me out and yelled at me. That is NOT a form of respect especially to a customer and not only that, the ENTIRE staff was fooling around and not getting any of their work done. Very unprofessional and needless to say, I felt very disrespected and disgusted. I have NEVER been treated in such a more disgusting way than this team that was on today.

"Huffy/puffy employees with an attitude that will NOT listen.

Had to wait for the woman to come over again (with the next order) to ask for seasoning and she walked away before I could specify the flavor (ranch). Handed me a random flavor (cheesy) and walked away again. Had to wait for her to serve the next order to ask for ketchup.

Overall very unorganized and chaotic service. A very loud, crowded, and dirty location with no bathrooms.

Also told me that the payment had not come through and I requested to cancel the order but, 3 minutes later I was charged with the order that I never got so, Im  making this complain because I am pretty upset and disappointed because I always eat in Mc.

I was stunned to read reviews of this location on Google.  Not our experience at all.

My wife and I both agree that this was the finest, cleanest, friendliest McDonalds we have ever been to ... dating back to the mid 1970's!  That's a lot of McDonalds all across Ontario, Quebec and probably 30 states in the USA.

We stopped on our way through for a quick bite at about 11:30 a.m. Thursday May 9 and again at about 1:30 p.m. Monday May 13.

"Worst experience ever!! First the cashier gave me attitude about using the app for the $1 large fries, he sighed when I showed it to him. Then said in a rude tone that I need to show him the bar code (in the past I just show them the number and they type it in) Then literally rolled his eyes when I told him it was Apple Pay and said ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½whateverï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Then stared at me after taking the Apple Pay, so I figured I would get the receipt at the next window. I pulled up to the next window and they told me the other guy has thrown the receipt away. Got home, looked to see how much I was charged and he did not apply the app discount to the fries.  My fries that I had ordered well done,  both large and medium were cold and soft (I live a block away) the nuggets were old and the cheeseburger bun was not soft.

So all they did was note NO Bacon, and still charged me the full price for a Bacon Mcdouble. When I got to the window I clarified again, but was told they didn't have that in their system, and that I had to pay the full price for the Bacon Mcdouble. I asked ro talk to the manager who then told me they didn't have what I ordered. I told him to go out and check his menu, because it was on there. He told me he didn't need to, that it was not on the menu. He was very rude and dismissive. I realize it is just a few cents difference, but why should anyone pay for something they didn't order, especially if what you ordered is on the menu. I see no reason to be treated so unprofessionally, and rudely. I don't recommend visiting this McDonalds, luckily there are plenty of others near by who treat people with respect.",1 star,1,0

Both the chicken and doubles had no - no - no flavor at all and was dry as sawdust and cardboard. For the sodas one was a diet coke and other was a reg coke, both were large size which they did not get right the first time. Both sodas tasted like they were full of cinnamon flavor.

The food was over dry and tasteless. The staff at this location needs to learn how to throw away yesterday's old food..if not last weeks old junk..

@McDonald's corporate you need to investigate this location immediately. The customer service is highly lacking and I'm positive the management of that location is damaging your brand. Not only is service extremely slow but the drive through service provider and the manager is horrible. We literally witnessed people driving away from the intercom after waiting and waiting with no response. We drove up to the intercom and waited and waited. Zero response. We spoke multiple times. No reaponse. No one greeted us. No one asked us to wait. Nothing. Radio silence. Then we dro e up to window only to face a combative manager with a chip on his shoulder. Needless to say we drove away without making an order. It was an experience that definitely does not live up to the world renowned brand standards of McDonald's.,1 star,1,0

"On 10/04/2022, at approximately 12:55 p.m., i ordered my food through the mobile order app. I entered curbside 5. After 15 minutes of no food being delivered, I walked into the store. I spoke to a manager and she told me my food was outside. I went outside, my food was no where. I went back into the store, i asked one of the curbside deliverers if I could please have my food as my lunch break was about to expire and I was going to be late. She stated she would check on my order. However, she had time to walk out with another gentleman that works at the Mcdonalds, walk outside, and give a good bye kiss. When I finally received my order 25 minutes later (1:15 p.m.), the bread on the big mac was soggy and my fries were now stale. Last to say, I ended up throwing away half of my big mac and all of my fries. This store needs a lot of help from corporate.

"Just to preface, I'm not a McDonald's regular so I don't know what the norm is for this location.
I placed a mobile order, and when I came to pick up it disappeared into the backroom chaos.  About 10 minutes go by and there were people overflowing the drivethrough and the indoor registers.  I figured I'd just hang out and just check in every once in a while, since I had nothing pressing to do.
Dozens of orders went through while I was there.  Most of them went through slowly, and a LOT needed substitutions since many products weren't available.  The store's CO2 went down, so they couldn't give out soda.  Bottled drinks were being subbed for soda, shakes being subbed for ice cream, lemonades being subbed for tea.  They were trying with what they had, but what an absolute madhouse...  Listening to the regulars in line, it sounds like this has been common recently.

This exercise of curiosity went on so long (~an hour) that there seemed to be a shift change.  Two of the new employees got together and figured out my mobile order.  Apparently, mobiles don't process automatically and need some kind of manual start by an employee - which didn't happen the previous times I asked.  Because of this, I'm sure that this doesn't reflect in their service metrics at all.

The employee that was able to help me asked first for my order number.  The number she was looking for was supposed to be something like '756' or '1691', like you see on your paper receipts.
However, that number is not actually sent to you via the app nor by email.  That sounds like an oversight with mobile ordering, rather than the local store.
After they figured it out, it took maybe 30 seconds to get my food.  Super weird experience.",1 star,1,0

"I've been here numerous times and have no complaints about the food or the staff. As mentioned in other reviews here, there is a problem with the overall cleanliness of the restaurant and the ""transients"" that call the place ""home"".

I'm not sure if there is a homeless shelter nearby or if people just love to hang out in the place, but there are always less fortunate people there especially in the morning. Just this morning I've witnessed the NYPD escort a woman out of the restaurant that was loitering. There are signs throughout the restaurant that clearly state No Loitering and that there is a 30 min time limit. Now that the weather is getting colder, people are just looking to stay warm.

Unfortunately, McDonalds is in a difficult position. As a former General Manager of a fast food restaurant, I used to deal with ""rough"" teenagers and ""undesirables"" especially at night. I wanted my paying customers to have a friendly, warm and inviting environment to eat in with their families. The ""rough"" crowd made that very difficult to maintain. I, like McDs started with signs. The McDs in this review also has full time security to help keep the people safe and moving.

You see, you just can't stand at the door and not allow people to come into McDs. The best you can do is try to manage it. I give them a lot of credit for trying to do just that. I also give credit to the employees as they have to deal with it all day long. As far as the cleanliness, they can do a much better job there. I can't speak for all the people given Lobby Duty, but I've never seen one with a cleaning bottle and rag to clean the tables. So, even I had to sit at a table this morning that wasn't clean. It wasn't exactly disgusting, but it wasn't clean either.

I've never been in the bathrooms because I try to avoid them at all costs. I've seen the people that come out of there and also the bathrooms at Penn Station down the block. It can't be pleasant in there and frankly, I wouldn't want to clean it either.

There are other McDs in the area, but this one is at times convenient for me. You can't beat the price for breakfast in that area in NYC. I would NEVER bring my family there. But for a quick stop in the morning, it's ok.

So, the 3 stars are just for the environment, the ""ambiance"" and the cleanliness. The food and the staff are great, it's just a ""difficult"" place to eat in given the community.",3 stars,3,0

"There was an excruciating 15 minute wait time for two simple breakfast sandwiches, and the place was empty. When checked, the sandwiches were actually missing the cheese.
While waiting, some filthy guy was exchanging $80 in singles for twenties. After he got done with his banking transaction, he actually spun around and walked right into me- talk about the bum rush!!
The true danger here, though, is when you try to enter. There is a welcome sign at the curb directing cars to enter into a single lane driveway where the drive-thru actually exits. A head-on collision waiting to happen.

That's when one of the employees said  quote on quote why yall played  like that . Both incidents ms Taylor whose suppose to be manager could not control her staff , neither could she tell me who was in the drive thru taking my order.  She has no control over that staff !! And clearly does not know how to run her shift!!! Horrible horrible experience when ppl are spending money at this location You guys really need better staff and managers who can run their shifts and not let the employees run over them because clearly that's what's going on at this location  I have reached out to cooperate  once and until this  is solved I'll keep reaching out !!!!",1 star,1,0

For one, outside the place smells like a landfill. The inside is covered in flies and old decorations from months ago. Every table is dirty, the bathrooms are atrocious and the garbage is overflowing. If that were tolerable, the food certainly is it. There's always something wrong with the order or the food is old and stale or overcooked. We have had multiple issues with their soft drinks machine. Either the soda is warm, there is no carbonation or both. If someone suggests I go to this McDonald's again, I'll kindly tell them I'll eat my own foot after trouncing around in manure.

"No cashiers/order takers; you must use their self-service kiosk which they have several of. You take a number sign to your table and staff will deliver your order to your table; however, this wasn't the case for us. The employee came from around the counter and yelled our number while she stood in the nearly empty lobby. We were seated less than 6 feet away from her and in her line-of-sight. We raised our hand and said, ""that's us"". She saw us, but made no attempt to deliver the food. I don't mind getting up and getting the food from her despite the kiosk saying it would be delivered to our table, but, I'm feeling a little like an unpaid employee at this point...we placed the order ourselves as well as served ourselves the food despite paying the same amount for the food that a full-service McDonald's charges. Several people in-store and in drive thru returned food due to being cold, old or not made correctly. This included us...at 1:00 in the afternoon the nuggets were cold, chewy and seemed old. I would think this wouldn't be the case given 1:00 p.m. is during the lunch rush. Fries were cold presumably because they were sitting on the tray well before the rest of the food was ready. Double cheeseburger was made correctly (no mustard or pickles), but bun was not warm/dry and cheese was cold/not melted. 4 managers were in the kitchen (button-up shirts with ties) along with 6 employees yet there was a lot of standing around doing nothing and operating with a shuffle-paced, leisurely-stroll walk. I worked at McDonald's and Burger King as a teenager and was always told, ""If you got time to lean, you've got time to clean"", and that was during slow/dead times, not lunch rush. I will say that the manager I returned my double cheeseburger and fries to (we ended up just eating our stale nuggets because we were told it was going to be 5-10 minutes for fresh ones) was nice and when I told her she could just microwave my burger she insisted on making a new one.",1 star,1,0

"Very poor service! While on a long road trip we stopped in to get gas and coffee. Upon entering the McDonald's the floors were extremely dirty, but we came after lunch so maybe they had a busy lunch rush. Then when I stepped up to the counter to order, the menu screens were stuck on frozen 2 advertisements. Then I order 2 Caramel Mocha  Coffees. After about 3min of waiting the kid behind the counter tells me the machine broke he needs to get the manager. Come to find out the machine is on auto-clean and it will be 18min before our coffee is ready. Not wanting to wait around they tell me they can give me two regular coffees. When I tell them that regular coffee is 1$ a cup and I was charged 7.58$ for two specialty coffees they offer to make up the difference in food. That's nice and all, but we did not want nor need any food. I ask for just a refund at that point. Mind you this whole ordeal takes almost the 18min for the machine to finish cleaning but by now I just wanted to get out of there. The staff were all very young and seemed very poorly trained. While they were nice and tried to make it right, I think better training of the employees at this location is necessary. While waiting for my refund I watched multiple other customers receive the wrong order or had issues with their food.

"I ordered a Mcdouble, which was on their outside drive thru menu. When it came up on the order screen it was shown as a Bacon Mcdouble, I told them that I just wanted the regular Mcdouble, no bacon. So all they did was note NO Bacon, and still charged me the full price for a Bacon Mcdouble. When I got to the window I clarified again, but was told they didn't have that in their system, and that I had to pay the full price for the Bacon Mcdouble. I asked ro talk to the manager who then told me they didn't have what I ordered. I told him to go out and check his menu, because it was on there. He told me he didn't need to, that it was not on the menu. He was very rude and dismissive. I realize it is just a few cents difference, but why should anyone pay for something they didn't order, especially if what you ordered is on the menu. I see no reason to be treated so unprofessionally, and rudely. I don't recommend visiting this McDonalds, luckily there are plenty of others near by who treat people with respect.",1 star,1,0

"I almost always use the drive-thru and English is my first language and I'm born in New York City. That being said, numerous times I have been unable to understand the other person in the booth and they cannot understand me. Sometimes it is faulty intercom issues itself. But, often it is someone in the booth who does not understand or speak English properly! This is highly frustrating when I have to repeat my order as much as six times! Yeah, I said six times! Last weekend,  it was an Indian kid  who I could not for the life of me understand! And he could not understand me. A polite enough kid when I reached the booth, but seriously frustrating experience! Other times it's someone who does speak the language properly, or a close facsimile LOL but they are distracted by their phone. When I finally reach the booth to pay, often, and usually female LOL, the cashier is thumbing through her phone. McDonald's needs to set some standards for the people who work the drive thru. If you are face to face with a cashier with language issues, it's easier to deal with, but, Don't put these people on the Drive through intercom! By the way the food is just fine there.

They were overwhelmed and didn't warning about the long waiting time. In some cases one hour and a half. This is considered the largest McDonald's in the World so it is another tourist attraction in the city. They should improve their service, especially in the pizza area.

"BIGGEST MCDONALD'S IN THE WORLD!!!

We drove by this McDonald's and talked about how it was probably one of the biggest McDonald's in the world. After googling it it was! So we had to stop in!

It was definitely a cool experience. They offer More options than just the traditional McDonald's. We did build our own pasta and the pasta was excellent!

They also offer pizzas and different pastry options. Like cheesecake, cake, ice cream specialties.

This is a two-level McDonald's but looks to be four stories.

The first floor is the dining and kitchen. Second floor is a large play place that's two storage tall and they also have a arcade where you can earn points towards toy prizes. Kind of like Chuck e cheese..

We spent a few hours here It's spent around $30 for four of us. So it wasn't that bad.

Definitely cool to say you into the biggest McDonald's in the world!",5 stars,5,1

"If I could give this place zero stars I would after my experience here tonight. The employee (manager) handling the front end was the rudest individual I've ever met of all my visits to McDonald's in my 30 years. Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for food. One lady said she'd been waiting on her food for over an hour. They wouldn't even accommodate her with a refund. Infact my order $25 took 40 min to fill. The store shut down the kiosks, as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the lobby. I understand it's easy to get overwhelmed but when you're filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an hour, your prioritizing methods are failing. And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy customers. I'm on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant again. But if I were a local, they would have just received their last $25 from my pocket. My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller McDonald's in down town orlando, the management  lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team poorly. The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on duty.

So i get to the window after showing the pic they still say so you want 2 and 1 extra? Oh i snapped. Then i asked how much is one hashbrown. He said $1 ohhhh i snapped lol so the deal is you get to pay a extra $1 for 2 ? So i just said give me 3 $ hashbrowns. Then they said its tax.. I wanted to jump out of my brand new suv .. Lol i now see why they have those videos of people jumping on fast food workers! So i gave them my card and call the manager and he was just as smart as them. Armando said we do have sandwiches for $3. I almost threw my phone. I said i never asked you about a sandwich i said hashbrowns. Smh then i just said good bye sir you'll be hearing from me again.

But the meal is quick and cheap.  It got the job done for a good pre workout. The ordering process is kiosk here at this location, so you can wait in line or use the kiosk.  Overall good",5 stars,5,1

Thank you. The only thing was that the quarter pounder seemed small and was overcooked and dry.... But we will be back!

Megan was very friendly and helpful with ordering... If give her 5 stars ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿""we don't do refills here."" What?

At the drink station, there were scattered cups and catsup splattered on the counter and floor.  Counter service was excruciatingly slow.

"To be clear, the rating of 4 stars is perhaps generous (I debated between 3 and 4 stars), but I ate at this McDonald's pretty late, so I'll assume the staff was just tired and ready to go home. The place was fairly clean, and service wasn't terrible, but it wasn't stellar either. They originally forgot the cookies my friend ordered, and when they did get them for him, the didn't have all 3 chocolate chip, so they gave him 2 of those and 1 sugar cookie. I understand that, but rather than just telling him, ""Hey, we got you 2 of those and 1 of these,"" they should have asked, ""Since we only have 2 chocolate chip, can we give you those and 1 sugar cookie?"" That's just polite. Also, the ketchup was out, even though they clearly weren't busy. All this being said, they took the order quickly, apart from that were friendly enough, and got the food out fast without any mistakes (apart from that). If I'm in the area, I might stop by, but the McDonald's in Marlton is much better.",4 stars,4,1

I was light headed. I figured let me stop at this McDonald's seeing that its on my way home and close by. I was surprised the shake machine was up and running. I ordered large fries and a Strawberry milkshake. I paid to much money for a little nit of food. My fries had way too much salt on them. Because they mixed fresh fries with fries that wrre sitting out basically old kinda stale. The milkshake had vanilla at the bottom with Strawberry on top. But that nits what kinda upset me it was the size of the shake. I was asked what size I wanted. Of course I was confused. I guess all McDonald's are not the same. I said small. But the cup I received was a cup size you order off the dollar menu. And I was charged like 5 bucks for it. Smh. Never again. I thought shake size was only small or large.  Not a baby cup size.,1 star,1,0

"Mobile ordered food and waiting about 30 minutes before going in and asking. The young man who helped me was very nice but the other man who was working the counter was AWFUL. He called a mans order once and while said man was getting up to go to the counter the worker said ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Oh? Not here?

When the young man who was working on my order stepped away to grab something the man grabbed my bag and asked what it was and why it was sitting there and started to throw it away. Luckily the one helping me stoped him and finished my order. While I understand they were busy but that is no way to act.

Then I went to the cashier and she just gave me a blank look and motioned to the pick-up counter without saying a word.

The arcade had a few money grabbers where it took your money but no game But the skeeball had a machine that let you play for free.

And when I went to order I took a second to take my phone out to show her the deal I wanted and she snapped at me and said HELLO and repeated my order and said OKAY?! I said yeah but I have a deal I want to use. She waved it off and said ""it don't work"". She was snapping her fingers and voice. I literally just got there and she was just already angry standing there. I took my card out to use and she said ""You have cash? That don't work!"" As if I knew. She didn't state it beforehand. What I didn't understand was everyone else before me ordered with a card? So I just told her I don't have cash and walked off the line. I saw people using their cards and when I saw that I got upset. I just got done working a long day and I was tired and hungry and just wanted my McChicken and fries. I got back on line and there was her friend. The friend told me to insert my card. I asked her if it works she said yeah. I said so WHY did the other lady tell me otherwise? Then the lady saw me on line again she said ""I just told her the app don't work why is she asking again?!"" I said ""Actually, you also said the card reader doesn't work and it does so I wouldn't know what's true or not?"" She said ""WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE TALKING TO?!"" ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICE. They both started laughing. There was a pretty big spider walking around on the floor too. All the tables were dirty. And the guy cleaning was on his phone and rapping.

"I think I had much higher expectations of this McDonald's because I was strongly suggested to visit.  I expected a 30 foot statue of Ronald McDonald and it ended up being a lackluster 30 foot lighted outline of Ronald on the building.  The picture online of the building made it look like it was made of a French Fry building structure.  It wasn't.  They had a separate drink station where you gave them your drink order (an extra step because no self service ones anywhere).  They had a separate dessert station, and a walk up food counter to order or self-serve kiosks to order from, where they will serve if you eat in (but not the soft drinks).  It is 2 stories.  The 2nd floor is a play area which I expected would be huge (it isn't), and a small arcade area...very small.  The menu showed some items different from other McDonald's but 95% of them showed OUT OF STOCK. So we just ate the kind of food you could eat at a regular McDonald's only it cost MUCH more! All-in-all,very unexciting and not what it should be for being the WORLD'S LARGEST MCDONALD'S! ï¿½ï",2 stars,2,0

I was light headed. I figured let me stop at this McDonald's seeing that its on my way home and close by. I was surprised the shake machine was up and running. I ordered large fries and a Strawberry milkshake. I paid to much money for a little nit of food. My fries had way too much salt on them. Because they mixed fresh fries with fries that wrre sitting out basically old kinda stale. The milkshake had vanilla at the bottom with Strawberry on top. But that nits what kinda upset me it was the size of the shake. I was asked what size I wanted. Of course I was confused. I guess all McDonald's are not the same. I said small. But the cup I received was a cup size you order off the dollar menu. And I was charged like 5 bucks for it. Smh. Never again. I thought shake size was only small or large.  Not a baby cup size.,1 star,1,0

Unfortunately for me my husband picked up dinner for me from there and I very Unfortunately didn't specify which one to go to... although this one is closest to home I will drive all the way to Altamonte to avoid it, and the way gas prices are that should tell you all you all need to know. Tonight it was missing fries (we ordered a total of 6 whole items so I can see how that was overwhelming to this bunch) and freezing cold fries which I have no idea how you can even do since even if it been under the warmer for a while... stone cold fries? I wouldn't put it past them they kept them on a counter somewhere instead though. And on top of that I made the mistake of asking for extra pickles on my big mac which I'm sure put this kitchen in a frenzy so they just threw all the ingredients in the box so I can do my own assembling of it... which was probably for the best because who knows what chaos it would cause for them to assemble it.

This is true for this particular restaurant, however, it seems that being soooo busy (I guess excellent location) makes them impervious to concerns about customer service or satisfaction of their customers.

Running out of lettuce, running out ""of many things"", are management/logistics problems. Bad attitude, lack of courtesy, well I guess that problem is on us, the customers, right?

"To whom it may concern. Your curb at the entrance of Hawian Bvld at International Drive is dangerous to cars turning right to park. The curb extends to far out to the drive and is blind to drivers in SUVs are high sitting vehicles. I can tell by the damage to the curb, that I'm not the first to experience this and damaged was caused. As a suggestion you may want to paint the curb bright red or install a Yellow caution post to alert drivers. The right think to do would be to correct it.",1 star,1,0

So I asked where I should order and she said ""not here"" and when I asked her again she said to come in the lobby. So I drive around and tried but the doors were locked so I went back to the window again and she took my order, and then I get home to find the crispy chicken sandwich I ordered is just bread, pickles, and sauce.

"MOST INCOMPETENT MCDONALDS EVER

THEY ALWAYS FORGET OR CONFUSE PUTTING SAUCES IN YOUR FOOD

Yesterday we went there ordering the 40 McNuggets with 2 fries deal. We selected four different sauces. When we unpacked the stuff at the beach, we found they gave us only 2 instead of 4 sauces. And these were 2 ranch, while we ordered different sauces. Also we got just 1 instead of 2 fries. Next day we ordered a happy mal and again the nuggets sauce was missing as well as the ketchup!

We were inside a Walmart McDonald's. My granddaughter has food allergies to egg & dairy. So there are only a few things that she can have. We had ordered her a kids happy meal with apple slices but they gave us french fries instead. The beef frying oil has dairy in it so she can not have the french fries and they were all out of apple slices. Next we ordered apple juice. They were all out of apple juice as well. The girl employee that was trying to help us did not believe me that the french fries had dairy in it. A happy meal hamburger and apple slices is all she can have here.

I ordered breakfast on a Saturday. It wasn't too busy but when I got my food I was missing some sandwiches, my pancakes were super cold like if they had just defrosted them and put them in my bag and the hashbrowns were literally stuck to the wrapper and the bag they came in looked like it had been dunked in the deep frier.

Save your money, go eat somewhere else where the food is actually edible.

"Being a pregnant female the experience I had with working there just recently was very terrible I was treated very poorly by my managers and coworkers. I had only one break my entire shift which means I could only eat one time and my manager daisy made me take a break in the mornings which wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t right, to eat early and then go hungry till I got off.

I would like to sue for discrimination against my pregnancy and harsh treatment during my time working there. I felt very uncomfortable. The Hispanic females that work there are like the ones in charge they even take mini breaks but I only had one my whole shift pregnant female standing in one spot for the whole day the only person that was nice was Kimberly .

A worker brought paper towels up,  said there was no toilet paper and let his girlfriend jump in line in front of me to use the bathroom. Couldn't even get in the men's bathroom the door was locked and you couldn't get in there.  Told the staff about it and they could care less I've never been treated so poorly.

Staff appeared to all be wearing masks, which is appreciable given their position of making food for and interacting with such a confluence of travelers from far-flung corners as they must. Food quality was on the high-side of McDonald's very small margin of differentiation. Only hic-up is that the space is not built for intimate conversations, and since they don't yell at you over the ambient hustle and bustle, I had some difficulty hearing the teller taking our order, as well as (though at a near table) did not hear our order number called -- hence I took off a star for ""ambiance"" in my rating here.",5 stars,5,1

"So, I got to this location frequently, despite hearing the horror stories about this location, because it is close to me. Well, tonight my order was messed up and they yelled at me about it.
First, I tell the person taking my order that I would like a Bacon Double Quarter Pounder w/ Cheese, Tea for the drink, make the combo a large. So, the first thing we have a discussion about is that he gave me an unsweetened tea on the screen. I tell him I would like a sweet tea for the drink, and he tells me that I ordered it wrong. I said, ""Well, normally when I come here, they default to sweet tea."" I said that because they usually do  He said, ""Nah! That's not how we do it. Then, he clears the entire order and puts in a Quarter Pounder with Cheese.

I tell him that I ordered a Bacon Double Quarter with Cheese, sweet tea, and make the combo a large. I saw that it was not right on the screen, but he repeated the order to me correctly.  I pulled around to pay for the order and waited on it to be served to me. I checked the order and told the person at the window that it was not a double. The person at the window talked to the person who took my order, and he came to the window and yelled, ""I MADE WHAT YOU ORDERED."" I told him that I said ""double"" several times when I ordered, 5 times to be exact. He person who took my order, who looked to be a manager, yelled at me, ""NO! IT WAS THE WAY YOU ORDERED IT. YOU ASKED FOR A SINGLE.""

I repeated that I asked for a Bacon Double Quarter with cheese and he started arguing with me about how to order sweet tea. He finally told me that he would make it order, but I did not trust him at this point, so I said that I was leaving and I would not be back.

This was an awful experience and I will not be back. I will also tell my friends and family to avoid this location despite that it has served our community over 10 years.",1 star,1,0

"If I could give this place zero stars I would after my experience here tonight. The employee (manager) handling the front end was the rudest individual I've ever met of all my visits to McDonald's in my 30 years. Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for food. One lady said she'd been waiting on her food for over an hour. They wouldn't even accommodate her with a refund. Infact my order $25 took 40 min to fill. The store shut down the kiosks, as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the lobby. I understand it's easy to get overwhelmed but when you're filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an hour, your prioritizing methods are failing. And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy customers. I'm on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant again. But if I were a local, they would have just received their last $25 from my pocket. My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller McDonald's in down town orlando, the management  lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team poorly. The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on duty.

After 20 minutes I ask again about my order and the supervisor tells me ""one at a time, I can't skip your order in front of other people"".  She then proceeds to continue skipping my order to serve other people.  At 45 minutes I asked again and she finds my order on a table and says to her coworker they never made it.

When I have ordered here, they mess up the order almost every time.  I wonder if there is a manager here because the employees seem more intent on fooling around and laughing than paying attention to their customers.  They need to get things straightened out and realize that if they don't provide better service, they will go out of business.

Is this how we run businesses in NY.  I guess McDonalds cares about ALL of their customers, no matter how unsafe they feel.  They just want their money and can't get sued by someone less fortunate, for being kicked out even if they haven't ordered anything. Good job McD's.",1 star,1,0

We went through the drive-through and ordered 2 bacon-cheese burgers and 2 big Mac's and we asked for them to leave the middle part (the bread in the center). We got the bacon-cheese burgers and they were fine. But the big Mac's not only still had the bread in the center but had another piece of bread on the bottom with mac-sause on them. So instead of 2 pieces of meat and 2 pieces of bread I ended with 2 pieces of meat and 4 pieces of bread. I was not amused when I got home.

"Absolutely the slowest service I've ever had at a fast food restaurant.  Me and my 3 friends went and we all used the kiosk to order our individual meals.  After 45 minutes and having to talk with the manager we finally got our food.  There was one person working fries, one cook, on manager assisting the cook, and one employee who was supposed to be putting the orders together and delivering to the customers.  The last person walked around like a zombie who had no idea what planet they were even on.  He would pick up a bag occasionally and put it back down and the clear orders from the system and not give anything to the customers. Then when customers complained he would ask them what they ordered and the try to find food for the. After seeing that 3 customers who ordered 20+ minutes after me and my friends I asked to speak with the manager. He proceeded to lie and said that once and order has been on for a while the automatic delete off the que.  So he had no idea what any of us ordered. We had to give him a receipt and the he helped us 10 minutes later. All the trash cans were over flowing into the floor and the restaurant was very dirty.   All the employees including the manager didn't even look 18 years old. They were definitely under trained, mis managed, and probably under staffed.",1 star,1,0

"The workers there are not professional,i went in there to get my morning coffee and heard one of the girls using profanity and customes can over hear them, then the cashier told me to give her a second and she went to the drive through window and start taking customers at the window while there was already someone there handling the drive through customers, i stood at the cash register close to 20mins to place my order, then on another occasion i placed my order on the mobile app the young lady made my ice coffee and left it by the machine , another team member asked what i was waiting for i then told her my ice coffee the girl that made it told her im waiting on my ice coffee too 30mins later im still standing there without my coffee then the girl turned around and saw me standing there still then saw the coffee sitting there and eventually handed it to me, and note i was the only customer left in the McDonalds, other customers came in placed their order got their stuff and left a long time ago, im suggesting more training for these individuals working at this location. I have observed this for a while now and said nothing. I turn my head everytime i pass there now, if you're running late for work i suggest walking through the drive through you'll get your order more faster than going in.",2 stars,2,0

Meh! It's McDonald's what can I say you get what you pay for. Don't expect the place to be clean or the employees to be over the moon with courtesy. Like I said you get what you pay for. This is not a bad review it's just a Meh review because it's McDonalds. It's not like you're eating at a five-star Resort and getting a massage afterwards. However if McDonald's does decide one of these days to start serving alcohol I might have to pay it another visit. I don't go to McDonald's often. I only stopped in out of convenience. Like I said this is not a bad review to disrespect McDonald's in any way.,3 stars,3,0

But they didn't cook my quarter pounder to temp because it was still red on the inside of the meat which was disgusting. I had to go to the door in order to get my burger fixed which then I ran into the situation of them starting to close their doors 5 minutes before they were supposed to close at 12 and the employee looked at me and said we are closed when I literally was holding the burger in my hand to show for proof. I look at the employee and say I know I came up here because I had just ordered from the drive thru this burger and it isn't cooked all the way. She takes the burger doesn't say anything and shuts the door with me standing outside. I then wait thank gosh she came back with a new one I didn't know if she was going to.

Our order was customized and the worker made a few mistakes. When I asked what was going on, he started making rude comments and asked if I spoke English.
I asked for the refund, and the worker refunded me $3 less. Then the manager came, and fixed the refund error. The manager was calm, but didn't offer any apology.

The saddest part is - this is a flagship McDonalds location, advertised as the biggest McDonalds in the world with Play Place and Entertainment. I hoped to see exemplary service and atmosphere, but it was a huge disappointment.

"We have always visited this branch when we are in Orlando. As always, food prices in this particular location is very expensive. You can not get the morning deal of $2.39 compared to other location in. South FL. It is $3.79 for chicken biscuit and if you want to add a hasbrown, it becomes  $6.79 and since you like to add a drink, you have to add $0.60 for a sweet tea. Small size hot coffee is $1.99. Still a wonderful experience since they had the place renovated. We experienced our first kiosk ordering here when it was first introduced.",4 stars,4,1
The kiddos love to stop by and play in the play places.  This location has a bathroom in the play area which is awesome for the potty training years.

I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning. This morning I forgot my wallet. I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than $5.00 breakfast tomorrow. They said so sorry No. I pleaded with this new manager that I'd never seen before. I asked for the manager that I'd spoken with on several occasions.
She refused to see me, and he stated that her response would be the same!!! I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us. He said it would be discarded!!!!

Seriously, I asked. So, I said that you'd rather throw it away then let me have it, a faithful customer.....So my lesson is now, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. McDonalds doesn't care about my patronizing their establishment and I'm going to seriously break my coffee habit. No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me.

I work at Ponderosa Steakhouse next door to this McDonalds. I have visited this location many times. When there is no business and its slow the workers just stand around talking like nothing going on. I've tried to place my order many times in hopes that I'd receive my food fast enough to get my food and head to work next door before I have to clock in and start my shift. The management is slow and doesn't help out as I figured they wouldn't. My mother went here as well after dropping my off at work to only experience this as well. Many people have to wait foreverrrrr just to get a simple order. The last time I went I just ordered an ice coffee French vanilla and instead of handing me the ice coffee they placed it besides a counter and made me wait 12 minutes for it. I didn't ask anyone this time because im just feed up with this location. If you want McDonalds DO NOT! and I repeat DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION!!!

I said, for my inconvenience I would like to have the tea. She looked strange, and I said please let me speak to your manager.

Do not come to this place. I come here expecting nothing and every time come out disappointed. You can always expect your drink to be watered down since they have them sitting pre-made. While waiting for my food i was forced to hear the obscenities that were screamed out back and forth between the employees. One employee even asked for a straw and a pregnant employee asked him if he wanted to be masturbated by her left or right hand. Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not making this up. The employees there,1 star,1,0

"I want the word to go out about James at this location. He is the worst manager ever! And to the Watson group that owns this location, I'm going to make sure that I spread the word not to visit this location because of James. We waited over 10 minutes because you had only one drive thru open and things were going slow. Well the clock just turned to 11 and we wanted breakfast. They told us no. Even though we were in line long before then and it is not our fault that everything was going slow. I called James and I was upset. I didn't swear but instead of him understanding how this would be frustrating, he just kept giving excuse after excuse and then whined that he wasn't going to talk anymore and hung up on me. Like I said, I didn't swear but I let him know that it was rude how they treat people. IF I CAN GIVE ZERO BECAUSE OF JAMES, I WOULD! Learn to understand your customers.

The serving girls treat people as unwanted guests in their own house, not serving people, they would fight with 1/2 of the customers, sending for police 2 or 3 times daily. Slow service, and bad manners, you  would feel like a kid getting his food from his angry mother, with some cursing whispers that you don't understand ' in Spanish' . Totally crazy.",1 star,1,0

Service was fast, quick and extremely efficient. Waiting time was less than 5 minutes. Good fast food spot for a quick bite to eat! They also offer order yourself service and of course on the app too! Food was good. The only reason I couldn't give this McDonald's a 5 stars was because many tables and chairs to eat in were a bit dirty. Also, the restrooms were dirty it could have been better other than that #eatoutside and don't forget if you like my review please give it a thumbs up!",4 stars,4,1
"I am not going to hold it too much against that them this particular store is in a part of town where there are a lot of homeless people. Any other restaurant in the same area would have the same struggles. Yes, there are a lot of homeless people in the parking lot and in the store, but there is nothing about this that is threatening to one's personal safety--I say this having gone here easily 100 times (my doctor thanks me). There is also an employee always in the parking lot or the store wearing a black shirt that says ""security"" in big white letters. What this person's actual background is in security is less certain--probably the entire training consists of putting on the shirt. The store is not as clean as one is used to with McDonald's franchises, and the drive-through service tends to be slower. I assume this is because they have a hard time keeping good help. Still, at the end of the day, I am impressed that the workers are generally courteous and the food is generally the same McD's consistency and quality, even with the particular challenges of being in this part of the city.",3 stars,3,0

Sat in the drive thru for 30 minutes before being able to order.

Two other cars followed suit so we couldn't even leave when we wanted to and were forced to stay and order because we along with the traffic trying to leave the parking lot was blocked in.

"They were careful about maintaining social distancing, an encouraging sign.

"Drive through experience. Long line, no problem, tourist area. Took a while to take my order. When I paid, the person didn't even make eye contact, he gave me my receipt without saying a word except for the total and shut the window. Then, went to the 2nd window where the guy gave me the water bottle and sent me to the 3rd window. By the time I paid, at 10:02 pm, it was 10:20 pm and I was still waiting on anyone to come to the 3rd window. Then a female employee brought me a kid's meals and when I asked her for the rest of the order, she waved her hand and said ""I don't know"" with an attitude. She left and I waited 5 more mins before anyone came to the window. A male manager came and I explained what was missing plus to look at the happy meal that only had 4 fries, cold nuggets, no toy, no sauce, no napkins. When I showed the kid's meal, he said what happened to the fries? (as if we ate them). I looked at him and said ""that's what you guys gave me and to look at the camera"". He then said ""hold on"" and slammed the window. Another 5 mins go by, gave me the food and I asked where is the sauce and he said the 1st bag, but it wasn't there. As he was getting me the sauce, I told him this was the worst service ever and that I was going to put a review. He shrugged his shoulders, slammed the window and left. I then proceeded to hunk my horn very loudly to see if he came back to the window, but he never did.
I'm a store manager myself and I would never tolerate a behavior like that from any of my managers or from any of my team members. My 6 year old grand-daughter was in the car and was crying with this upsetting situation.

They have a large parking lot, and the bathrooms were clean during my visit. My only recommendation would be for the managers and employees to meet up behind the restaurant or in the break room instead of right in front of one of the main doors of the restaurant. It made the place look like a corner store and cheapens the image of this brand. Their service was top notch and although they were packed during this visit the food came out fresh and without any delays.",4 stars,4,1

"Read down place has changed a lot! Getting to be excellent place to go!

Not good, new construction is nice. But understaffed. Even at 2-3am you can walk in and find over half of the tables covered with trays and garbage. Also the floors heavily littered. Yes you are supposed to buss your own table at a fast food restaurant, but alot of foreign/domestic vacationers are just filthy. They just drop food and wrappers everywhere. When they are done eating they just get up and leave.
Host/busser is needed for the dining area for the sloppy pigs. More register coverage for the guests. When a crowd of people have to go through one register while the kitchen staff waits for orders is inefficient.
I have had 2-3 errors in my 8 visits. First one was when they put extra mustard on burger instead of adding mayo. Second was they ran out of hot fudge and instead of telling me they used the coffee chocolate topping for my Sunday's (yes 2 of them).
I caught the first error quickly and was easily fixed properly by management before I left. The 2nd error wasn't caught till we where eating the Sunday's at home. I took one back as proof of the error to get a refund. At first they only wanted to refund one but with several minutes of bickering they refunded both. Yeah it was only $1 and some change but it was the principal.
I walk to and from the restaurant since I have no car it is about one mile away from my home. I always request 2 plastic bag's for my food because the one paper bag they put my 6-8 burgers fails halfway home. The 2nd one is for the 3 Sunday's.

Another epic failure, ordered 2 mcdouble no mustard and onions. 2 bacon mcdouble  and 2 mcdouble regular. Received the 2 mcdouble wo/mustard and onions no problem. 2 bacon mcdouble had no bacon and no mustard fail. 2 regular mcdouble had no mustard either fail. 2 large fries ordered and received 2 medium sized fries and 2 of the smallest sized fries I've ever seen (guess they where kids sized) fail. The 20 peice fry came without incident. Less than 1/2 of the whole order came correctly....

"Very average McDonald's experience overall. Was cool because of the whole ""largest McDonald's"" bit, but it was extremely hectic inside with kids running and screaming everywhere. Took a while to even get the opportunity to order, then food took a while to get to us, which is understandable since it was so busy. Ice was out in 3/4 soda machines. Not a very clean place either. Pizza was alright. Very dry, flavorless crust, pretty soggy and could have used more time in the oven/ the oven could be hotter. If they put like 20% more effort into the flavor of the pizza it would be a lot better. Onion ""slivers"" were also just onion chunks. Not a big deal, just a little misleading. But what else you expect from a McDonalds. Food is a little pricier than the McDonald's I'm used to as well. Would probably have a better experience making the effort to dine elsewhere.",4 stars,4,1

I ordered the oatmeal and a hash brown.

An employee Nlnamed TJ brought our food to our table. I noticed I didn't have the apple chunks and raisins that come with the oatmeal. I let her know she went back and brought me what I needed.

I then noticed the hash brown I ordered wasn't on the tray either.
I let her know and she apologized, then comes back with not one but 2 hash browns, which oddly enough my young child decided after we got our food that she did want a hashbrown now. She comped a free hashbrown.
She was such a pleasant person to deal with.  Her customer service and customer care abilities are 20/10

I over heard he saying to another customer that this location isn't her usual location and she is a General Manager.

She took care of evryone around us, with an amazing attitude and a smile on her face, which is a rare occasion.

This place is ridiculously high compared to the McDonald's just down the street. $20 for what is normally $10. On top of it didn't even ask if I wanted any sauces with my chicken McNuggets. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra couple of miles to any other McDonald's,2 stars,2,0

"Good food. Pretty fast considering lunch rush. I would give 5 stars had the manager not been to rude to myself, other customers and employees, not to mention his inability to pay attention to orders.

"I placed a mobile order when I was at the McDonald's at 72-69 Kissena Blvd, Flushing, NY 11367. I placed that order on March 29, 2023 at 07:48:29 PM. This order should be brought to table 101. The McDonald app said that in 2 or 5 minutes, somone will bring my order. I waited for 15 minutes. I still did not see my order at table 101. I went to the counter and asked for it. A lady saw a tag with 101 on the counter and then she prepared for my order, and then gave it to me. I asked her why no one brought me the order. She did not say. Then, I asked for the manager. Then, a gentleman named Armando showed up. I told him what happened. He first told me that they were busy. However, there was no one waiting at the counter. I told the manager that the lady who prepared my order saw my order tag on the counter. Then, the manager changed his explanation. He said that after 7 PM, they don't serve table service. In other words, they don't bring order to the table after 7 PM. I said that the Mcdonald's app says that the table order is still available. Then, he said that every store is different. I doubt what he said. This is bad servcie and bad responses from the store manager. The manager lied.",1 star,1,0

"Worst McDonalds in the USA! I would give this place a negative star if it was possible. There are a ton of homeless, creepy people hanging around outside and inside. The staff are totally clueless, rude and have no concept of customer service. I waited for 10 minutes on my double quarter with fries, when it came out, the fries were cold as could be. The cashier couldn't care less about my cold fries as she was busy flirting with some seedy looking guy who was hanging out around the counter. This restaurant would maybe be ok in the urban sprawl of Chicago or Baltimore, but I expected much more from one in South Beach. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",1 star,1,0

"This McDonald's usually ROCKS!
They can get thru a line that goes all the way to the highway in under 20 min.

Tonight,  there was no line. Also the inside was closed. AND...  THE ICE CREAM MACHINE WAS BROKEN/SHUT OFF. SHOCKER.

My son did something amazing at school and wanted a Sunday for a treat. So thats why we went.

Then they didn't put all the things we ordered in the bag and we drove off. 2 u turns in traffic and waiting in line now to get what they forgot.
So... I asked the manager if they could just add a small bag of fries since we had to do 2 uturns to get this item they forgot to put in the bag. She said No, we can't do that.
REALLY!?!?!?! I have worked in the food industry for 28 years.  I am well aware of what you can and can not do.
You didn't WANT TO. You didn't want to value me as a person, a customer,  or a future. You didn't want to do your job properly in the 1st place. You didn't want to apologize in any way shape or form.

I don't mind that a mistake was made. I do mind that they acted like it was my fault for ordering anything to begin with.

This McDonald's is just wow. Some days you get good food the majority of times is just bad food. I ordered a big mac meal from them. When i got it the bread was old hard like it's been sitting there forever. The nuggets were old. Awful customer service. The majority of staff are pretty much children. There's no type of discipline or order in this place. If you don't like your job just quit it's that simple. But we're paying alot of money for service like this that's just obserred.

"Worst customer service ever!! I was invited to come in after having to wait over 45 minutes on the drive thru. Manager Priscilla calls me to apologize and invites me back with my family, I explained I cannot come back next day, but would come following Sunday, she agreed and hung up. On Sunday I come to the restaurant and there is another manager Cynthia who I explained the situation and she grunted the whole time she took the order. While on the service line, she tries to contact the manager and right there from behind the line, she asks me yelling, what is your name, I tell her and again in front of EVERYONE, other customers included, yells again, ""she tells me you came in already!!"" I replied NO, at this point I'm embarrassed and upset and I hear her that she tells the person on the phone I already put it down. Twenty minutes later, I finally get the order. I ask her to change the fries on some of the things that were ready because they were cold. The manager grunts and agrees to. After my family were done with their meals, we had ordered ice cream and we asked to hold off until we were done. When we returned, we asked for the ice cream and we had asked for chocolate, they said that we had ordered vanilla and the manager gave us one less of what we ordered. Incredible! Bottom line, we were invited to come back to make it up for bad service and McDonald's came through, we got yelled at by the manager, embarrased, long wait for food, missing food items, and pissy attitude by staff. Next time I get invited back I guess I gotta read the fine print or ask for what am I invited to come back for.

Burgers being served without lettuce and tomato you now have to purchase this and when you do its very tiny pieces. The burger meals are over priced. Service was on acceptable. We have to be sitting in a dirty, untidy and unattractive area. Worst of all why is there a sign in the restaurant telling customers you only have 30mins to eat and leave, like really. That sign needs to be removed. Not returning to this restaurant. Fix up and clean up the place.",3 stars,3,0

Total DISGRACE to McD brand.
We placed an order and paid at the self-serve kiosk. Receipt did not print out. Took our order # in vain hope of seeing the food. No such luck. You need to push yourself through the crowd at checkout counter to wait for order to come out. After 10+ minutes, we heard ""quatro"" screamed out by an employee.  That could have been our order, except it was missing few pieces, and none of the employees at food handout desk spoke any English to understand what I was telling them. NONE.  And my Spanish was not good enough to get the point t across either.
I went back in line, waited another 10mins to speak to a woman taking orders manually, who had to ask for an English speaking manager to troubleshoot our order.  Eventually, order was remedied, handout employee was instructed in Spanish how to fix our order, which she did, finally handing food to us with a farewell message of ""go cuno"".
You can lookup what that means, or avoid our mistake and NEVER go to this McD at all costs.",1 star,1,0

"ýýýýýýýý Happy ýýýý Thanksgiving 2019. ýýýýýýýý

This McDonaldýýýs located at 262 Canal Street, in Chinatown, New York City have been here for ages.

All McDonaldýýýs are created equal in terms of cleanliness, so it is no surprise that it is very clean, neat, tidy and spotlessly clean.

It is a huge McDonaldýýýs because it has 3 stories, but on the second and third floor, there is a limited number of chairs.  Poor design left it with about 40 to 50 seats on the 2 top floors.

The staff is very professional, friendly and polite with a smile, and there are staff who are bilingual {English and Chinese) (English and Spanish).

"This McDonald's has always been bottom-of-the-barrel as far back as I can remember, and a sleek face-lift doesn't change the fact that a visit to this McDonald's will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. The list of their offenses is too long to detail every one, so I'll compile a list:
1. Incorrect orders 50% of the time
2. Rude employees and managers
3. Customers who are loud, offensive, and downright violent
4. Poorly made, slapped-together food

And perhaps the most disgusting new violation is that recently they claim to have leased their parking lot to a private booting company, P.B.S. Parking Boot Service, and troll the parking lot for people who step off the property to boot them and demand $200 cash in exchange for the boot removal.

"Growing up in Orlando, I visited this location as a child and knew the Oerther family. Decided to take my child here for her first visit and sadly, was left pretty infuriated.

First, I timed it and it took 25 minutes for us to receive our order. We had to stop and ask an employee what the hold up was. When they finally brought our order out to us, my daughter was missing her drink which you can clearly see on the receipt, is there (Tea & Lemonade). I asked another employee about it, he took my receipt and never came back. So I had to leave my hot food and go stand at the front for a good 5-8 minutes, just to ask a third person for the drink. How hard is it just to give me a cup that I clearly didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t receive and I will just make it myself at a machine?

Best McDonald's I have ever visited. This is one of the few McDonald's in the USA that still serve pizza. On top of the coal fire build your own pizza they have custom pastas and build your own omelets. The jungle gym for the kids is huge and they bring your food right to the table. The trash cans are automatic as well as the seat covers. To add icing on the cake (which they also have at their dessert bar ) there is an arcade with a prize table.

Some days you'll sit at the drive through line for a long time then get told to wait in a parking spot. Whoever owns this franchise should be proud of it and maintain it's quality that it had. As far as the food goes. Well it's McDonald's same as any other.,2 stars,2,0

The service is bad and so is the food. They give you what they want not what you pay for especially as it gets closer to closing time. Food should be available and fresh no matter how close it is to closing. Workers should understand that if they dont wanna work let somebody who wants to do the job. Not suprised at the amount of negative reviews but I am suprised that ownership and management does not take these reviews into consideration. Complete disgrace!

"This McDonald's has always been bottom-of-the-barrel as far back as I can remember, and a sleek face-lift doesn't change the fact that a visit to this McDonald's will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. The list of their offenses is too long to detail every one, so I'll compile a list:
1. Incorrect orders 50% of the time
2. Rude employees and managers
3. Customers who are loud, offensive, and downright violent
4. Poorly made, slapped-together food

And perhaps the most disgusting new violation is that recently they claim to have leased their parking lot to a private booting company, P.B.S. Parking Boot Service, and troll the parking lot for people who step off the property to boot them and demand $200 cash in exchange for the boot removal.

"After decades of serving families, McDonald's is on their way out. I blame it on the district managers not doing their jobs. McDonald's needs individuals who can read, comprehend and speak English. Today I went there for lunch. I ordered #6 Filet-o-Fish sandwich meal. I ended up with 10 peice chicken nuggets. Hmmmm....I  guess the order taker did not know the menu item or understand when I said Filet-o-Fish sandwich. I quickly caught the error and told the cashier. She said, ""So you don't want it?"" Then, the manager came along to find out what the problem was. I  explained and received the sandwich. I left and when I  got home, I found out I  had a frosted breakfast pastry in a ,Filet-o-Fish box! Come on now McD's. May we get better service and expect a lot more from you?

The parking-lot was clean. The inside of the McDonald's cooking area looked really clean and spic and span the only reason why I'm giving it three stars is because the food quality was not great at all so if you can improve that then you can either get another star or two more stars it depends on what you guys want for you to McDonalds.",3 stars,3,0

We were visiting. From out of town and came through the drive through for some breakfast. The bacon egg and cheese biscuit was so hard it must have been under the warming light for hours!! It was impossible to eat. My sausage mcmuffin was so dry - not at all what I am used to and I order these regularly. After getting to our hotel room (less than 10 minutes from there) and finding out how terrible our breakfast was we called to let the manager know. Not only did she insinuate that we were lying but was less than professional by far. I have not complained to a fast food establishment for over 4 years. So when I feel food is this substandard and take time out to call I would have expected some common courtesy not an ignorant attitude especially from management. Needless to say when I come back this way I will not be eating at this location. If I were you I wouldn't either!! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿,1 star,1,0

Without giving me a chance to explain he walked off.   To add to the bad service I discovered after leaving, my pancakes were cold.  I don't usually go to this McDonald's, and usually don't get bad service at McDonald's but figured I'd take the time to let others know how this McDonald's is treating it's customers!",1 star,1,0

So she went in then the security guard need to use it and then the employees where talking about my daughter I went up there and told them that If they would take better Care and clean your place it would be up. Plus you have food over every where they don't wash there hands they don't clean the tables then you ask for a wash cloth to clean they say we don't have any clean.

"This was the worst McDonald's I've been in. We ordered using the kiosk and  they had numbers to pick up and take to your table where they would deliver your food. We waited 20 minutes for the food and it was dropped on our table without any courtesy. The coffee I ordered was missing as was the cup for my husband's drink. He went to the counter to get it and they didn't believe him at first. My coffee had the label on it for what I'd ordered but it didn't have any sugar in it so I added one and stirred it, took a sip and got a mouthful of grounds. The egg and sausage mcmuffin was cold as were the hash browns and  the coffee was tepid. I assume it had been ready quite a while before it was delivered. Usually when I get this meal things are quite hot. The whole thing was pretty dissatisfying and put me off McDonald's for a while. The staff didn't seem to be receptive to complaints so I made an online complaint on the McDonald's website and we left.",1 star,1,0

Worst McDonald's ever. None at the front counter so we were forced to use the one working kiosk. Had to show the person in front of us how to use it. We ordered two happy meals. No receipt was provided. We were asked to sit outside to wait for our food. When our order was complete it was left on the pickup counter without notification. Order was missing fries and the person we finally tracked down said we needed a receipt. Absolutely rediculous.,1 star,1,0

"Good morning, Please tell me if this matters or if I'm being to sensitive or petty or overly concerned. Maybe because I didn't have my coffee this morning.

I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning. This morning I forgot my wallet. I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than $5.00 breakfast tomorrow. They said so sorry No. I pleaded with this new manager that I'd never seen before. I asked for the manager that I'd spoken with on several occasions.
She refused to see me, and he stated that her response would be the same!!! I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us. He said it would be discarded!!!!

Seriously, I asked. So, I said that you'd rather throw it away then let me have it, a faithful customer.....So my lesson is now, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. McDonalds doesn't care about my patronizing their establishment and I'm going to seriously break my coffee habit. No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me.

Not only did their security guard get rude with me they didnt even have the professionalism to let me know it's against rules to charge phone to make an order. Only was charging to phone to make order thru app. Then after getting kicked out they wouldn't give me a refund or my food, said to call number.

Two people got shot after an altercation at this McDonalds. I walked past this morning and two low life thugs were bashing each other up with blood spilling over their faces.

"We went there during NYE, just prior to the ball drop. The surprising thing was there was homeless folks inside the store walking and smoking next to us when we were preparing to eat. The homeless guy was even asking for food to someone next to us. It felt very much like a 3rd world country's experience. The tables were dirty as well - maybe they need to hire more people for cleaning in between customers. The French fries were cold as well, as if they were probably heated long time ago. Also, the store associates should provide a tray for customers who are going to be sitting/eating inside the store instead of paper packets for takeouts.",1 star,1,0
"Food was fine. But, when we came a large family were at the cash taking kiosks so we used a regular kiosk and waited to pay cash at the register.

It wasn't overly rude, but execution was totally annoyed at us the customer. Hope it's not like that next time we visit.",1 star,1,0
"This McDonald's gets a 3 rating due to their lack of attention to drive thru orders.  Numerous times we get home after a visit to McDonald's and notice the forgot to include apple slices, or apple juice.  I agree these are smaller items and do not effect the price much, however, when you have kids waiting for their orders get very upset and get angry n hurt that these things are missing.  It is very upsetting!  Also, we tend to order a lot of unsweetened ice teas.  8 out of 10 times the tea tastes disgusting!!  It is old tea or the bag doesn't get changed when the make more.  I get so mad that no one seems to care enough to be sure every shift cares to do their job correctly to ensure a high quality in ALL their products.  I have brought these concerns to numerous managers and employees but never get satisfaction that they care and fix the issue!!  It may be ok for a week but happens again or on a different shift.  All emplyees should care enough about their jobs and themselves to do the best they can in all areas of a job performance!!!  Please do your best to inform this McDonald's of these issues and have them retrain and fix these issues.  My sanity and their job performances depend on this!!!  Thank You!!",3 stars,3,0

It smelled really bad inside (like a restroom) and the ceiling was leaking behind the food service line which makes me question the quality of the food. On top of that there were homeless people lingering around. One asked me for money TWICE. Once before I ordered and once afterwards. The cashier also didn't know what she was doing, she kept asking the manager for help making service slow.

I asked one of the staff (tall, skinny lady with curly hair upfront) if I could get my food cooked to order and she gave a slight nod as a response which I found extremely rude then moved over to the kitchen area so I decided to ask ANOTHER manager upfront and she was actually quite nice and went straight to telling the people in the kitchen and the moment she did the manager I had previously spoken to decided to turn around and say the slight remark ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½You already told me, I got it, thanksï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ which I found very rude coming from what youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½erd to my surprise yet not so surprised self I received very mildly warm food, it tasted and was very obviously sitting there for longer than I wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve liked + it didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t meet my simple request of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿",2 stars,2,0

"went to drive thru around 10pm last night
we clearly ordered 5 Deluxe Crispy Chicken Sandwichs and 1 Double Quarter Pounder with 3 fries
The guy messed up and gave us 4 crispy chickens (the smaller ones), 1 quarter pounder (also smaller), and almost mistakenly charge us with 30 fries (this was sorted out though)

"Tonight 02/17/23 I was in this McDonald's, things were calm and fine. Then all of the sudden, some guy started yelling at the staff about customer service. Demanding customer service number to complain. Fine, that's his right. But as the lady at the register tried to help him, he kept yelling at her. They said that he was an officer in the Army. To me, that is disgraceful and highly insulting that anyone would use rank and the military to treat people like that. I don't believe he is any sort of military let alone an officer.  And I did tell him that ""if he is a retired military officer, he is a disgrace of a former officer."" To which he wanted to go out and fight me. Furthering my belief he is no officer. I was an E-4 Specialist and know that he or any other member of any military force is trained to use rank or status as an excuse to belittle anyone. And if you do you disgrace the uniform the military and your country by treating anyone with disrespect.  I'll stand up to anyone who tries's that type of behavior.  The staff at McDonald's was doing a fantastic job, my food is delicious.  Thank you!",5 stars,5,1
"I don't love it. It's an unfortunate weakness in my DNA that I can't be hungry. I was a hungry child and find myself eating fatty foods just to feel full longer. I know it's bad.

"This McDonalds is hit or miss depending on the staff. Its quick most of the time due to the dual drive through order stations, but that can also work against them and can slow down you getting your food at times to if you get out of order.
They seem to have  great breakfast team, but the dinner team is hit or miss. One day its great and the next time your order is all jacked up. They are normally pretty good with the normal menu items,  its the specialty stuff they jack up, like a Big Mac is Good here but a Grand Mac won't be because they leave off half the sauce or something silly, 5 lbs of lettuce, you get what I mean. Inside tends to be better then drive-through if you have the time.",3 stars,3,0

This location is said to be the largest McDonald's in the world! We stopped in after a day at Universal. We arrived after 11 and it was crazy busy. Our order took at least 30min before it was ready...but under the very busy circumstances it was understandable. They have unique dishes such as pasta and wood fired pizza which seemed very popular. Multi level seating....games room and various entertainment segments through the store as well to make the experience even better. Lots of free parking and dual drive thru.

This one McDonald's I find charging $2 for a large coffee everywhere else it is $1 for any size drink and the reason I go to McDonald's at all is because of the coffee but if they're going to double the price of the coffee then I may as well go to any 7-Eleven so I have to save this one particular McDonald's would not lower the price when I told him that it was $1 everywhere else. Arguing with a customer is not a good idea it would have been a better idea if she would have said I'm going to let it go this time but no they actually try to argue the point and I think that's silly the whole reason that I come there at all is because of the $1 coffee that is fairly good on a one to 10 scale I would say McDonald's coffee is it seven or eight with Starbucks being a 10 especially when they suggest you get the expresso shot that is $4.25 for the large coffee with the extra espresso shot from Starbucks and then there's creamer but that for dollar coffee is four times better than McDonald's one dollar coffee so you get what you pay for I just think McDonald's at that particular Stevens Creek location bites off customers,1 star,1,0

I'm not sure what anyone who has lived in Utah expects when trying to dine in this area. It's pretty common knowledge that downtown is the heart of the homeless and many drug addicts. Not to mention this location is one block from pioneer park and very close to the road home/gateway area. I'm not excusing any rude or bad experiences but maybe just a bit more patience and compassion? It's fast food. Don't like the area? Dine elsewhere.,2 stars,2,0

This mcdonalds is a heinous cancer on society. They will boot your car if you are there longer than thirty minutes or they assume that you did not eat there. there was a guy hanging out accros the street filming people parking. He had us on camera going into the mcdonalds we had a receipt and he still put a boot on our car. After arguing with him and going over footage and receipts he finally admitted his mistake. What an atrocious piece of garbage company. This experience is the last straw for a sub par fast food restaurant.

So when I go to get my coffee, everyone knows you are entitled for one free refill but to my surprise this Mc Donald's does not honor that. The person at the register who's name is Estella (mexican woman) was the one who took my order and made me feel real uncomfortable and awkward when I asked politely for my refill. There were others on line waiting to take their order and I feel like she deliberately embarrassed me. There was no need to make me feel degraded, at the end of the day I am a customer and I have no need to bring my business here.

THEN I PROCEEDED TO CALL THE NEXT MORNING AND ASKED TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER, EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED TOLD HER ID LIKE THE MANAGER NAME FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE TO REPORT IT TO COORPRATE, SHE THEN TOO HUNG UP IN MY FACE TOO!!!

"My order is WRONG every time; the most frustrating customer experience. I live near this new location and have visited 6 times since the remodel, and I've concluded that this location is a 120% mess. If all of my orders are wrong I can imagine thousands of others are driving off with incorrect purchases. I ask for no cheese every time, and guess what is in my order.. CHEESE. Or my frys are half full, or the hashbrowns are completely missing, no syrup/ utensils are in the bag as requested. On 3 occasions we were told to pull ahead and park on the side while they remake my order, an employee brings out an incorrect order.. yes 3 times. Today this ""New"" team member blatantly tells me to go in and take of it... what the hell? Every other time I let the incorrect order slide, but today I decided to speak with the store manager. I let her know politely about all of my incorrect orders, and she replies ""Sorry"", I then ask ""what is mcdonalds doing about this, its every time the order is wrong?"" She responds ""I'm so sorry""... I ask again and same response.  Meanwhile the woman next to me is asking about the replacement order that she put in ten minutes ago, they apologize to her and say they are going to reinput it.... this new location is a joke, its truly insane that a Mcdonalds is operating like this, and its been a few months since their brand new building opened.",1 star,1,0

Can't take an order. I ordered 2 happy meals and they recorded one. At the pay window I corrected their mistake and paid for two. Then at the second window they only gave me one and insisted I only paid for one. They absolutely refused to give me 4 little nuggets and a couple of fries. This is the McDonald's closest to my house and I go there frequently. Well not anymore. I hope the $4.99 they stole from me with make up for the $40 I typically spend there weekly.,1 star,1,0

I gave her a good morning and a smile. I don't remember if I got a good morning back, but definitely didn't get anything close to a smile. It is opening and the place is filthy, from the floor to the tables to the restroom. Whoever closed the night before didn't even wipe the tables, so it's a bit understandable why she is irritated or whatever, but lady I'm not the one who left it like that so give me the smile you are paid to give me. It's literally your job. Plus smiling releases hormones that make you feel better. Thanks.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",2 stars,2,0

Whoever their trainer is should be ashame when they have the McDonald's conference in Orlando Florida. If I could give them negative stars I would.

Always very disappointing. I've gone to this McDonald's for 15 years now. The system has gotten more organized since the recent renovation but it seems the efficiency still has not improved.

Oak Park had an ordinance that stated ""no drive-in restaurants"" but Ray Kroc (founder of McDonalds wanted a McDonalds in his home town).  So in order to get approval to be built, THIS very McDonalds,  agreed to install stand up (hi-top) tables inside so technically you could eat inside.  It was to my knowledge the first McDonalds ever where you could sit inside and eat.  As I recall, it opened in/around 1966 or so.  It was a VERY big deal around the area.",4 stars,4,1

Perhaps when they did the remodel they should have gotten rid of the terrible staff as well. Come on McDonald's you can do better than that.

"A few days ago my boyfriend went to this mcdonald's to get us something to eat. I was excited, had just came home from a long day at work and was STARVING!!! Ready to eat, I took a bite, thought nothing of it, I then took another bite and look to see that I bit into a VERY PINK QUARTER POUNDER!!!!! So I grab my food, go to this mcdonald's and show them my burger was pink. They proceed to apologise and gave me a new one, I ask for gloves so I may examine this one. I do and find that this burger is pink as well, so now this is 2 pink burgers in total given to me. I tell them, they go ahead and apologize and gives me another... And yes, you guessed it, a third pink burger!!!!!! So at this point of course I am very much disgusted and appalled by their lack attentiveness of the food they are distributing to the point I ask another customer next to me if he had seen what I did.... I didn't want to feel as if I was picking but he agreed, he saw pink, so I finally asked for a refund and fresh fries and left. I will not support this mcdonald's again!

I even went as far as to ask her if I have the round egg instead of the folded and she jumped right to it and that was fantastic. Try it sometime it's wonderful thank you very much and God bless.,5 stars,5,1

The hamburger made up for it though, did you see the greasy heart attack waiting to happen?

Just an FYI, mobile ordering saved absolutely zero time at this location. We still had to go to the drive-thru and wait and they didn't have anything ready so unless you just like ordering from an app, don't bother.

I would still recommend eating here. YMMV on the staff at any fast food restaurant. Sure this guy was somewhat annoying by being slow but he wasn't intentionally being a jerk or anything.",3 stars,3,0

"I have to do this cause I'm upset with McDonald's as a former employee but also a business partner (if you can call Doordash a business partner)

They don't pay enough, so the employee turnover rate is high or they just don't show up, they have seemingly no limits on how many delivery and mobile orders people can place so they get backlogged, swamped, and can't keep up.

I parked, called, told them I had an order and they said to get in the drive thru. By the time I got to the window; they hadn't even started the order. It took 20 minutes in total. I lost money waiting on McDonald's.

Seriously, reformat your business structure. It was embarrassing working here and apologizing for the ineptitude of this company.

Be nice to the employees, it's not their fault. I'm not even sure it's the manager's fault, but they have to tell their higher ups about this.",2 stars,2,0

"I usually give high reviews but not this time. The service is excellent. Fast and professional staff all the way. Truely representing McDonald's culture. Unfortunately there is an issue with homeless people that brings this location down. The restroom has a bad odor because of the homeless people washing up in there. The restroom door doesn't close as to see what's going on in there such as drug use I can only speculate. There are plenty of homeless people going in and out of the establishment to eat and use the restroom. So they carry a bad odor. It ruins the atmosphere. It's depressing. I witnessed a homeless man get hauled out by Santa Monica Police for lounging around, not purchasing any food, and being loud and unruly. I applaud the quick response of the security officer on duty who immediately asked the man to leave several times always maintaining his composure, even as the homeless man escalated. It's a tough job, but it's getting done. The priorities are kept here. Customer satisfaction and safety are key to the staff and it shows.",3 stars,3,0

"Number of times we've ordered from this McDonalds: 3
Number of times they've gotten the order right: 0

It cannot be spelled out any clearer. ""Quarter pounder. Absolutely nothing on it. No cheese. Just the meat and the bun."" It is so simple. Under normal circumstances I would stick around for them to get it right. But they have a steady supply of drugged out homeless people begging for money right there in the drive through line, so running that gauntlet a second time is downright dangerous.

So I get home to see if i can salvage this order. Pull the bun all the way off to start scraping fake cheese off of it. The stale, burned bun breaks (picture). I successfully scrape the cheese product off the top only to find there's another slice of fake cheese underneath the patty as well.

I give up. #FightFor15, indeed",1 star,1,0

"It's a McDonald's. If you want you've eaten at one, you've eaten at them all.

However, this review is based solely on the location. 8th Avenue has a SERIOUS homeless problem, and the restaurant is always swarmed with them. If it were just that they were begging for change, I could forgive it. Unfortunately most of the people I've seen are out of their minds on whatever drugs and usually screaming and carrying on. They make me incredibly uneasy, to the point where I'm not comfortable eating here anymore. More than once, I've seen fights break out. Best to find another location.",2 stars,2,0

I stopped in for a quick bit, or so I thought. I had no issue with the food or the face that there was a wait.

At one time I was able to finally get the pink haired girls attention and I told her I was missing a coke. She told him and he went on flirting. I finally got his attention and told him I still needed my coke and he turned around and asked someone else to get it and went right back to his flirting.

We got turned away at the drive thru because they stated, ""we are short staffed and really busy, we can't take any more orders for 20 minutes"" and when I asked if I could wait in the drive thru, they told me no because the drive thru is timed and it would time out. I understand being short staffed and running behind on orders, thats understandable, but telling people you're not taking orders for the next 20 minutes.. I mean come on, I am not sure who is managing this location but turning away business? Seems like a poor business practice to me. This happened on 10/17 at 1030 by the way.",1 star,1,0

"The staff decided that there were no longer any mcflurries, after they prepared 2 sundaes and a milk shake . Suddenly the icecream machine was broken. A Spanish speaking customer after me was then able to order not only a milkshake but3 mcflurries. When I inquired about it I was told that it was now fixed although no one has gone near the machine during the time since I was denied IN ENGLISH. I then stepped outside to get my friends and tell them our food was ready, they took the tray and headed up while I put our other friend in an Uber. When I came back in security who had just been no more then 5 feet from me while I ordered, paid, and received my food, made someone come down to confirm that I was a paying customer. If only the counter staff was as particular as the security guard.

With the size of the big breakfast that would starve a child. Maybe you should start calling it baby breakfast.

"This restaurant had an nice increase in customer service once new management took over (at least I think it was new MGMT), and a remodel.

I'll only add that this particular McD's suffers from being next door to one of the largest homeless encampments in LA.  Be prepared to be asked (usually politely) by a transient for food.
Of course, this isn't really the fault of the McDonald's, and I'm not making any judgements. I eat here frequently, since it's just off the freeway near my house, and McD's in general has improved their food over the past few years.",3 stars,3,0

New bulding... same substandard food. They must get corporate McDonald leftovers. Not sure why the fries and burgers taste awful compared to other McDs. Cold wilty fries and the hambuger pattes looked worse than most. Hoped the new building would have improved food. Got a green quarter pounder patty last visit in old building. Disappointed, do not like going to Plattsburgh if can help it. maybe try again in a year. hopefully better experience then.",3 stars,3,0

People now are a afraid of ballpits and it was outside so it didn't get used over 6 months of the year.

There is ample seating, but I've seen more with more seating, but we've never been without finding a seat.  Everything is pretty clean and in good order. Walk-in orders are accurate and fast.  Drive in is fast and about 8 times out of 10 they will have it exact.  Some times they get it wrong, but like we say nobody's perfect.

Since it's right on Rt209 it's easy to get in and out of unless your traveling South on 209 then sometimes it's hard to pull out because there's KFC and Subway and an Ice Cream shop across the street so it's a busy little area in Brodheadsville.  Overall it's a nice facility.",4 stars,4,1

"For the third day, I went to this McDonalds, which I frequently always come to this McDonalds, my daughter and my niece love McDonalds, so each time I place my order, I ask for a medium fries  with my additional order, and for the three days that I went, they were given me burnt fries.  I'm sorry but I paid a lot for my order to begin with, I'm not excepting burnt fries, especially three days in a row. Each time I asked for some new fries, and then they would give me good fries that were not burnt. Except for yesterday, I got my money back.  I ask the girl why was she giving me burnt fries, and her reply was that they didn't change the oil in which they cooked the fries in. The point is as a customer you don't have to keep excepting burnt fries, or anything that doesn't look right to you. You are already spending so much money to begin with ,to be getting burnt fries. Lately there's been lots of issues with this McDonalds, people have attitudes, don't have manners, they don't even say hi  or thank you for coming. I'll be taking my service elsewhere.

I don't know where to start. OMG! This is the slowest MCDs restaurant in the world. Staff act like if they were on vacation. You can see in their faces that they hate working here and are just looking forward to the end of their shift. Manager came out after a while and there was no improvement in performance. The automated order system was not working so I waited in line for 10 mins. just to order and pay. From this point it was exactly 27 mins. until my order was ready. All that was was a bottle of water and a mocha coffee. And I had to ask them otherwise it would have been more than half hour. I reckon staff must really ask themselves whether they want to work here. There may be other better places where they could find job satisfaction. Here they're just turning a bunch of people into unhappy customers.,1 star,1,0

The same manager stood around looking at others needing help during the rush without any movement or intention to step in for her team or their long waiting customers.  The entire place was in disarray from the back to the front with filthy tables, floors, and bathrooms.  Every trash can in the place was overflowing and the pungent smells both in the lobby and the restrooms were enough to make anyone lose their appetite.

They recently renovated it so I was optimistic and took them in there for breakfast.  Right away there was a bum outside the door yelling to himself and when we walked in there was another one lying on the ground next to the tables.  I went back a month later for happy meals and the kids wanted to eat there.  All the tables and floors were dirty and they still had bums outside and in.  While we were waiting for the food a homeless guy wanted to use the bathroom but there was a lock on it.

"I was not given a receipt otherwise I would've complained privately.

I pulled into the drive thru around 2:50 PM. It was about a one or two minute wait before me and the woman in the second drive thru lane were answered. Before that, someone must have accidentally switched their headset on because all I heard was a lot of laughing and talking in the background.

When I pulled around to pay, the woman at the first window wasn't able to locate my order for a moment. But she triple checked to make sure that what she had was accurate. So I paid, received my change, and she shut the window without another word (or my receipt.)

I pull up to the next window to get my food and drinks. The girl at that window double checked which order was mine, then handed me my food. Even though I ordered a large Coke, I was given a medium Coke but didn't see any use in complaining because I didn't want to hold her lane up.

When I pulled away, I started eating my medium fry only to discover that the top fries were over salted and mushy. I figured they must've got mixed in with the fresh fries and kept eating. I was wrong. They only got worse. They got mushier and more stale. Like someone had reheated them in a microwave. Absolutely disgusting. I was too annoyed at that point to turn around and go all the way back. I don't expect fries to be perfect all the time, but I do expect not to get the fries that should've been written off as waste.

The only reason that I'm doing 2 stars instead of 1 is because the teens here are very nice. They go above and beyond to make sure everything is okay. Especially when I'm inside using the kiosk. But something about food quality and drive thru efficiency needs to be revamped. This isn't the first time I've received stale fries or had an order done incorrectly at this location. I only come here because this is the only McDonald's on my route that doesn't put me out of the way, but the lack of efficiency is seriously frustrating.",2 stars,2,0

"The prices are better in Utah than Idaho or Minnesota. Also, the McDonald's app has great deals. If you do the survey on the recite than you get a buy one get one free discount.
Since I have frequented McDonald's for a long time, I must admit that I have mixed sentiments regarding the eatery. On the one side, the meal is typically pretty decent, and I like the quick and convenient service. However, there are some problems that I've come to realize over time that make me feel like the experience isn't as positive as it once was.

The rising costs of the products on the menu are one of my main worries. Every time I visit McDonald's, it seems like the costs have increased once again. This makes it challenging to continue frequenting them as much as I once did, especially with the availability of more economical fast food alternatives.

Another problem is that McDonald's used to give frequent and significant discounts and promotions, but lately they seem to be less frequent and generous. This is disappointing because I've always valued the ability to occasionally save a few dollars on my lunch.

Having said that, there are still a few aspects of McDonald's that I genuinely value. The majority of the cuisine is delicious and good, and the quickness of service is still unmatched. The restaurant is always spotless and well-kept, making it a perfect choice if you need a fast dinner on the run. Overall, I would say that McDonald's is still a good option for fast food, but because of the rising costs and less promotions, it has lost its place as my top pick. However, a typical McDonald's burger and fries are a great choice if you're searching for a quick and delectable dinner.",4 stars,4,1

"My posts are going to start showing a lot of a "" one man protest"" for a while. I will continue these actions until I receive an apology from this story or until I get some backing..
This McDonald's restaurant continues to mistreat the poor and destitute.
1) requiring some to take their food to go
2) some they charge for a restroom token even after they paid for food and or drink
3) 30 minute time limit for the ones they choose to alow to eat in ONLY ENFORCED FOR THE POOR.
4) will not ask ""for here or to go""",1 star,1,0

This location is always running no matter what time or day. The food is always fresh and the service is usually fast. If they ever mess your order up they usually do right by you and give you a fresh new order. This location was renovated recently so everything is brand new. They no longer have the children's play area but it's much more of a sit in restaurant style McDonald's.,5 stars,5,1

Sometimes high tech doesn't mean faster. Location has multiple self service kiosk meaning instead of taking orders one at a time you have several being made simultaneously. Causing a backup waiting to get food inside while competing with drive-thru. Location still does not offer dining inside after ordering food. They had just mopped with 20+ customers inside so that was a safety hazard. Not to mention I overheard someone tell one of the employees that something was broke in the ladies restroom causing water on the floor.,1 star,1,0

"Hey, we just left this place. Had a big order - lots of people hungry after getting to town late. Among other things, we ordered 3 orders of 20 nuggets, 4 large fries, a bunch of dbl cheeseburgers and a quarter pounder. Know what we got? A drink we didn't order, an apple pie we didn't order, an ice cream we didn't order, and one 10 piece nugget. In a big bag that looked enough like one that would hold our order - our bad, I guess, but our not checking closely enough just doesn't excuse just not getting 40+ $ worth of food. And then they don't answer when we try to call. Absolutely terrible store.",1 star,1,0

"Incredibly slow service, sat in the drive-thru for at least 10 minutes without the line moving. When I finally got my food, the crispy chicken sandwich tasted stale, the texture was very chewy and not crisp at all; on top of that, I wasn't asked if I wanted any ketchup or sauces, the sandwich didn't have a drop of mayonnaise or anything on it, just oddly dry pickles, and a soggy bun. I had to park and go inside to get condiments. As has become almost expected with the McDonald's experience, the soda tasted like sanitizer. Never again at this location.

They have a fish tank here overcrowded with African cichlids, an aggressive type of fish who will chase each other around, nip at each other and other fish, and sometimes even kill them. They have one Bala shark, which is a very peaceful schooling fish who should be in a group of at LEAST 4 other Bala sharks. (Schooling fish can die from stress in some cases if they are alone.)  He is being nipped at, his fins are torn, and he gets about 16 inches long full grown. There are Plecos that also get about 24 inches long full grown in there too. I didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know who was in charge, I asked but apparently someone comes in to take care of them. I love the staff here! I just want to make sure their fish are being taken care of and happy. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½anld be very happy in there. :) Keep in mind the rule of fish is every inch of fish (think about how big they will be full grown) should have at least one gallon, if not two gallons of water to swim around in. The cichlids alone get anywhere between 6-8 inches, and I couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t even count how many there is in there.

"You have never experienced a food establishment like this one before. Probably because they've all been shut down. I've been reluctantly stopping in this place while shopping in Macy's for many many years and it's the same experience everytime. At this point, I do it for the entertainment. The kiosk and ordering setup is a recipe for disaster, just for starters. But you will usually wait 30-45 minutes just to be told that all the food and everything you ordered is sold out. If you're lucky enough to get your food, and it seems edible, there's 0% chance the dining room will be open. With all that said, it's not even the worst part. The staff are the craziest, rudest, nastiest human beings you will ever experience. They have zero filter. They scream and curse at eachother and the customers. One time I got yelled at for asking for sweet and sour sauce and they then proceeded to gather and talk about me asking for sweet and sour sauce, as if there's something wrong with that. After ignoring the request I asked again and she made an over exaggerated movement while rolling her eyes and putting her hand out, telling me it was $1. For 1 sauce. It was the best entertainment I've ever received for the money.",1 star,1,0

If you wanted coffee from this location, major of the staff cant make good coffee. I often look for a particular employee that makes it the best. On the other hand, this location is one of the most cleanest locations I've ever been in. Management does a good job making sure everything is clean and ready for business. Every time I come in their always cleaning the deep fryer, counters, refilling the machines and all, despite all the college kids and tourists wreaking the joint.

"This is by far the most unprofessional , location I have ever had the displeasure of visiting. The staff as a whole are lazy and not at all interested in customer or service. French fries taste like they were cooked hours before being served fountain drinks taste like bath water only slightly warmer. Hours are mis-posted on the entrance door and for serving product that is already cooked and just sitting under the heat lamp they are in a league of their own when it comes to the slowness of their service. I will gladly drive twenty miles out of my way to avoid this location in the future.",1 star,1,0

1 M Coke
Then she said: You have to ask for a large- We did!! She didn't offer to correct their error.

So I ask for my money back. The guy asked me for my receipt. For a dollar in the drive thru. I told him the lady didn't give me one. He takes a few minutes and then asks me to pull forward.

""For a dollar?"" I reply. Bc really this is ridiculous. The last time I pulled forward no one ever came! Plus the guy didn't even confirm what I am waiting for - a manager or my dollar?

"Stopped in here on January 24th 2018 and ordered at the counter, a signature classic grilled signature sriacha chicken sandwich with an artisan bun. Paid for my order and waited. When my order was ready it was handed to me in a bag.I asked for ketchup and proceeded to a table to enjoy my meal. First off tge fries were crispy which I prefer, but they were old and not at all indicative of the worlds best fries. I took out my sandwich took bite and noticed sesame seeds in the box. I Checked my receipt to confirm that my sandwich should gave had the artisan bun, proceeded to the counter  to correct the problem with my order to be told tgey were out of artisan buns. I was pissed and walked off. I finished my meal, went to refill my drink and spoke with a man in yellow shirt and tie behind the counter about how terrible that the one woman knew there were no artisan buns but the order taker at the register knew nothing about it as well as the girl who gave me my food. Someone should have confirmed that the sesame seed bun would meet my approval. And I notified him this kind of service was not indicative pf McDonald's and that I would be callong corporate. The following day I contacted McDonald's corporate who passed on my complaint to the restaurant location. I received a call from Rose who apologized for the problem with the order and asked that I come back and give them the opportunity to make tge meal properly per my request. I stopped in on Friday January 26th and Emma made sure that the meal was prepared to the standards I believe McDonald's is known. The sandwich was flavorful with the artisan roll and the fries were hot and fresh.

I asked for his name to put a review and he flat out denied. I asked for receipt before handing my credit card. He swipes it and returns back my card. I m waiting for a receipt with my family in the car. He starts inputing another order on his tablet. Waited for sometime and then I waive my hand several times.

"Whatever you do, do NOT go to this McDonald's location. There's a reason why I rated it one star and I can kindly explain why. While the food there is good, I simply cannot stare at these people the same way anymore. A hour or two ago, I showed up to get some food and there was this one woman working behind the register (I don't remember her name, but I assume she was a manager or something. She was in a blue shirt and glasses and that's all I can remember). There was an annoying beeping sound that seemed concerning and I politely asked (key word here is ""politely"") them to investigate it and make it stop. They didn't bother to check it, which shows that they're neglectful of the resources around their workplace. The reaction I got from this woman was 100% disrespectful and told me to get out of her store and never come back and even tried to call 911 on me. It's pretty obvious that I caught this woman on a bad day. Clearly, I was furious because I felt like she was deliberately trying to get under my skin and using that to her advantage. You know what they call people like her? A bully. I was bullied by the manager because I had a concern that needed to be addressed. I was not trying to show up on this woman at any point during my visit. I was trying to be as lenient as I possibly could. If the woman I was referring to was actually a manager of this establishment, she needs to be put in her place because that's NOT how a manager should treat her customers. I do not like being antagonized, especially by an employee and it really showed during this visit. Come to think about it, I've been checking on other reviews of this location they all had numerous problems with this particular person. Obviously, I'm heartbroken because now I don't have anywhere to go to eat after my work shift. I'm only relegated to the Chick-Fil-A a minute down the road and even I know they have better hearts and respect than this woman did (and their food is also good). As a man diagnosed with autism, I strongly advise people to stay away from this location at all costs. If you really need to go to a McDonald's, steer clear of this location. It's not worth your time and it's not worth your sanity. Also, their drink machine has been broken and flat for at least a few months and they didn't fix that either. I will be contacting corporate about the antics going afoot at this location.",1 star,1,0

"My over 20 year experience with McDonald's Restaurants in this area (Southlake, Grapevine, Keller, Northlake, and north FW) This one is by far the best one. I have been eating food regularly from this Roanoke McDonald's for a little over a year now.  This is the only place that makes the Big Mac the way I remember it as a kid. I do not post reviews often at all. I am making this one because of my experiences at all of the area McDonalds. If you decide to eat McDonald's, go to this one.",5 stars,5,1

One of the worst with service. I ordered a ice latte through the app for pickup. So I go inside I wait at pickup. Drink isnt ready and other people are waiting also. I mentioned to the solo employee I had a pickup order. She says ok then goes off to make other peoples meals. So I try to be patient stood there for like 20min and never received my drink. They never canceled my drink I left and was still charged for it. Also they never sent the 1 cashier who was struggling by herself no help.,2 stars,2,0

"Very busy McDonald's. They have, on the second floor, some games for the kids and families, and they also bring the food to your table. They have the regular McDonald's menu, but they also offer others kinds of things like pizza and pasta. I had the opportunity to try the pasta, and it was good. They have different options of pasta, sauces, veggies, and meats that you can add.
Now, this is what happened to me. When you make your order at the screen, and you order pizza or pasta, it is done at a different food station from where they do the regular food. After a few minutes, I got the pasta at my table, but the rest of the order was missing. Sadly, they lost the rest of my order (happy meal and a coffee). After 20 minutes, I talked to the manager about my order, and she didn't  hesitate to help me. She was very nice and she personally took care of my order.
If you ask me if I recommend this McDonald's, it depends. If you're looking for a McDonald's that offers more than burgers, yes. If you want your kids to have a little bit of fun without a time restriction, yes, it is a good option.  But if you are in a rush, no, I don't recommend this McDonald's.",3 stars,3,0

Severely understaffed for such a busy location. I've seen McDonald's with more workers in locations in the middle of nowhere.

"Extremely busy when we visited at lunchtime, with queues at most of the automated order points, and hardly anywhere to sit once we had received our food - which was good - from the rather harassed looking staff.

Despite there being a clearly signposted No Loitering policy with a maximum 30 minutes to eat your meal, this did not seem to apply to the rather insalubrious clientele who were occupying most of the seats in the back part of the place. I hesitate to use the word ""restaurant"" to describe this outlet.

As it is almost opposite the Tick Tock Diner, which was really busy at breakfast time, we had planned to try this McDonald's for breakfast, but after today's experience, we'll give it a skip.",2 stars,2,0

Chucky cheese or something? Although I think even they stay open longer than that, Friday night c'mon.

The area was clean enough (and I am particular about that), the kiosks were in working order besides one but it didn't hold up the orders at all.  Food deals were clearly marked,  the ordering system wasn't correct as you usually grab a tent and go to a table but one of the staff saw us wondering about it and told us to just put a number in... so they were clearly attentive to what was going on around them.  Food came out quickly.  Same cost for food as any other mcdonalds anywhere.  Great, quick,  cheap food for a late evening.",4 stars,4,1

"Let me just say, I don't think I've ever gone out of my way to leave a review for a fast food chain. Especially not the biggest in the world. It's so easy to think of these places as just another installment in a gigantic corporation, but I think it's important to remember that these places are made up of the individuals who work there

For that reason, after coming here for a couple of years, I have to say that they do a phenomenal job. I only ever go through the drive-thru, but after being so used to no smiles, miserable demeanors and a lack of basic customer service skills (thank you, have a nice day), I need to shout out how friendly and consistent everyone at the drive-thru line is here.

The women who take your payment are always nice, and even the woman who hands out the food (usually a job where you will get absolutely zero smiles) is always so nice and genuine.

If somebody owns a business and is looking for a good customer service and people who will treat customers as expected, then give people a shot based on everyday encounters like these.",5 stars,5,1

"Drive through experience. Long line, no problem, tourist area. Took a while to take my order. When I paid, the person didn't even make eye contact, he gave me my receipt without saying a word except for the total and shut the window. Then, went to the 2nd window where the guy gave me the water bottle and sent me to the 3rd window. By the time I paid, at 10:02 pm, it was 10:20 pm and I was still waiting on anyone to come to the 3rd window. Then a female employee brought me a kid's meals and when I asked her for the rest of the order, she waved her hand and said ""I don't know"" with an attitude. She left and I waited 5 more mins before anyone came to the window. A male manager came and I explained what was missing plus to look at the happy meal that only had 4 fries, cold nuggets, no toy, no sauce, no napkins. When I showed the kid's meal, he said what happened to the fries? (as if we ate them). I looked at him and said ""that's what you guys gave me and to look at the camera"". He then said ""hold on"" and slammed the window. Another 5 mins go by, gave me the food and I asked where is the sauce and he said the 1st bag, but it wasn't there. As he was getting me the sauce, I told him this was the worst service ever and that I was going to put a review. He shrugged his shoulders, slammed the window and left. I then proceeded to hunk my horn very loudly to see if he came back to the window, but he never did.
I'm a store manager myself and I would never tolerate a behavior like that from any of my managers or from any of my team members. My 6 year old grand-daughter was in the car and was crying with this upsetting situation.

"I don't like cold fries. No one does. When a sign says Customer Parking only, does that exclude customers 10 minutes into the future? I have waited longer than that in this location's drive-through. I had a combo stop to make. Pick up some rum and bring home some dinner for me and the wife. I parked at McDonald's and walked the 65 seconds or so to the liquor store. A purchase and the return voyage took all of five minutes. By the time I had returned, there was a boot on my car. The person responsible for this was in the parking lot and informed me that to be considered a McDonald's customer, I would have had to make my fast-food purchase first, and then been given  30 minutes in the parking lot. It's a cold November evening. Fast food sitting in a car would be cold by the time I had returned, so I did things in what seemed like the logical order. $90 later, I was too disgusted to eat.

"We usually always go before the zoo because it was cutely decorated to the zoo theme and the kids enjoy the experience. Service has always been meh but the atmosphere made up for it. Now it's just a boring, modern McDonald's with bleh service. The remodel was a mistake and if you're going to take away the only appealing part of the place at least make sure the service improves.

"This is THE WORST MacDonald's I have ever visited. First thing I noticed. Four white customers standing in line and the black customers being served their meals. The BLACK manager custom made their sweet teas, reassured them that ""all you have to do is ask for me and I'll """"have your back"""". They left more than happy. Meanwhile the untrained cashier cannot prioritize drink expediting. When one of the white customers asked the manager to assist, the manager just looked at him and turned around. In response, that white customer left very angry before ordering. After witnessing this obvious display of racism towards whites, another white couple simply walked out without ordering. Finally I ordered my meal. A Big Mac meal. It took five minutes to expedite my meal. The black manager yelled out my number, dropped the bag that contained my meal on the counter and turned and left. No thank you, no reassurance that I was pleased, nothing. I then waited 10 MINUTES for my large Coke!!!!!!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The cashier, who is responsible for making drinks, didn't know how to get more ice or restock the large cups.

They charge extra for additional ketchup, do not offer free refills and a tiny portion of the dining room is open after 1 am. They close off most of the dining room. One time, I went in to order something around 1 am, but was unable to find any seating because other people were on their laptop hogging the booths and not ordering anything. They were taking up space. Mcdonalds staff did nothing about it when we complained about there being no seating. Most Mcdonalds offers free refills on medium and large drinks, but not this one. One time I asked the manager for a free refill and he was very rude and dismissive.

Ready to eat, I took a bite, thought nothing of it, I then took another bite and look to see that I bit into a VERY PINK QUARTER POUNDER!!!!! So I grab my food, go to this mcdonald's and show them my burger was pink. They proceed to apologise and gave me a new one, I ask for gloves so I may examine this one. I do and find that this burger is pink as well, so now this is 2 pink burgers in total given to me. I tell them, they go ahead and apologize and gives me another... And yes, you guessed it, a third pink burger!!!!!! So at this point of course I am very much disgusted and appalled by their lack attentiveness of the food they are distributing to the point I ask another customer next to me if he had seen what I did.... I didn't want to feel as if I was picking but he agreed, he saw pink, so I finally asked for a refund and fresh fries and left. I will not support this mcdonald's again!

"Honestly, I hate to do this, but the moment I walked in, it smelled like a porta potty... and I was like ""let me just order"" I ordered 2 hot and spicy's NO LETTUCE, a large drink and a large fry. The Coke was ok, the fries like always (not full but fresh) and I got one sandwich with lettuce and one without. I told the kid in the front ""this sandwich has lettuce one it"" which prompted him to tell the guy and girl at the grill to please fix it... they shrugged their shoulders and pointed at the monitor and said ""well it only says one sandwich no lettuce...""

I mean come on guys. The kid at the register made an honest mistake and instead of going back and forth with him, just fix the dang sand which! Don't sit there and argue. So the guy in the back snatched the sand which and threw it! At that point I asked for a refund.. little did they know, I speak Spanish. So when the assistant manager asked me what happened I explained to her and she let out this LOOOONNGG sigh... so sorry I am an inconvenience to you, but if you were to train your team members some customer service this wouldn't have been an issue. Jesus, the kid at the register was really nice and well mannered. He gets a 5 star. But my experience was just horrible.",1 star,1,0

"This was the worst McDonald's I've been in. We ordered using the kiosk and  they had numbers to pick up and take to your table where they would deliver your food. We waited 20 minutes for the food and it was dropped on our table without any courtesy. The coffee I ordered was missing as was the cup for my husband's drink. He went to the counter to get it and they didn't believe him at first. My coffee had the label on it for what I'd ordered but it didn't have any sugar in it so I added one and stirred it, took a sip and got a mouthful of grounds. The egg and sausage mcmuffin was cold as were the hash browns and  the coffee was tepid. I assume it had been ready quite a while before it was delivered. Usually when I get this meal things are quite hot. The whole thing was pretty dissatisfying and put me off McDonald's for a while. The staff didn't seem to be receptive to complaints so I made an online complaint on the McDonald's website and we left.",1 star,1,0

"There is a major problem with this McDonald's!! I have been coming here for years, and I put up with alot of inconveniences! Non the less, last night was appalling!! What's wrong with the girl cashier tan skin, black hair, the Hispanic or Indian girl with the yellow long press on nails?! Im sure you can single her out of the crowd. I wont say her name even though they all kept saying eachothers names out loud like it was high school musical back there. Is it mandatory for her to not give me my receipt? I , like many other hardworking Americans who have been coming here for as long as we all can remember,  need a receipt; especially just incase how fast food workers forget to give us all of our order.. and wouldn't you know it, not only did they fail to give me my receipt,  but they failed to give me the correct order. I asked for my order more than three times! Is it also part of the owner's of McDonald's policy to berate the customer in Spanish? I'm Puerto Rican and I understand everything they was saying. How rude to have said all of that in front of the customer,  and about the customer.  Is this how you value your rewards members? I'm going to post about my experience on any social media platform! Mark my words! I would also like to state that the woman manager allowed her staff to keep acting maliciously and she acted as if nothing was going wrong. Is this how you run your establishment?!
The African American fellow, tall, with a kind of lisp, gave me again the wrong order and the wrong receipt. Must be nice to pick out the garbage a receipt from three hours ago to give to me, thinking i wouldnt know the difference! The owner should pop on in!! Must Like losing out on money.

And why is there a parking lot if we can't walk in. And how rude the associate was that I basically should have known better that they were only running the drive thru?

"I've been going to this location most of my life since it's not far from my home. So I've seen this McDonald's go through a lot of changes. The employees here generally have decent attitudes, there are a few that tend to be rude. The store is also dirty a lot of the time. It's a very busy location, and maybe it's from having a lot of foot traffic, but the floor is usually dirty, the drink station will be filthy and wet and sticky, the ketchup area will be out of ketchup, and/or there will be ketchup all over the place, too. The tables tend to be dirty, too, you usually have to clean off your own table. Also they have those light up tables that kids like, and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting there, and they won't be eating, and they'll have their stuff all over the place and sit there for hours. And mind you, these tables seat about 8 and there will be one homeless person sitting there. My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the lights, and I'll have to tell him he can't because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest table, is camping there. The employees don't seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for hours, but buying anything. Sometimes they'll even be sleeping at the table.
The kid's play area is also really crappy. They have nothing for the kids to play on like a playplace. They have 4 of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work properly, or at all. When I was a kid they had a huge playplace, which they took out when they remodeled the store. It even had N64's at one point, along with the playplace. But they took it all out and replaced it with a ""sitting"" place instead of a playplace. It's really awful.
So, all in all, this McDonald's is dirty, has a lot of homeless people that practically live there, and isn't really kid friendly. The food is okay, as long as it's hot food (I get a lot of cold food or my order is wrong), and the employees are generally friendly, but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather lackluster, meaning that you can tell they don't want to be there. This location needs a lot of work. And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in there. There hasn't been a single time I've gone there that there wasn't at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit at, with all their dirty things sitting on the table itself. The table is by the front counter, too and you can often times smell the homeless person that's sitting there the whole time you're waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your drinks. It is not kid friendly at all at this store. With the store being in a nicer part of town you'd expect quite a bit more cleanliness.",2 stars,2,0

"I went to McDonalds for lunch with my 2 little kids and Laurie took my order. One of the items I ordered was 2 cheeseburgers with NO MUSTARD.  She missed the request for NO MUSTARD, but I noticed the omission when she handed me my receipt. When I told her that I ordered my cheeseburgers with NO MUSTARD, her reply was ""No, you didnt.""  After that customer service blunder, she agreed to tell the person preparing my cheeseburgers not to put mustard on them.  Once we got our food, I had the unique experience of listening to her berate her cooking staff because they weren't going fast enough for the next 20 minutes while me and my 2 kids were trying to enjoy our meal.

I ordered the oatmeal and a hash brown.

An employee Nlnamed TJ brought our food to our table. I noticed I didn't have the apple chunks and raisins that come with the oatmeal. I let her know she went back and brought me what I needed.

I then noticed the hash brown I ordered wasn't on the tray either.
I let her know and she apologized, then comes back with not one but 2 hash browns, which oddly enough my young child decided after we got our food that she did want a hashbrown now. She comped a free hashbrown.
She was such a pleasant person to deal with.  Her customer service and customer care abilities are 20/10

I over heard he saying to another customer that this location isn't her usual location and she is a General Manager.

She took care of evryone around us, with an amazing attitude and a smile on her face, which is a rare occasion.

It's my local McDonald's so I wish I could rate it higher especially considering they added modern stuff like the DIY menu boards and the 2nd drive thru lane. But what's the point of a second drive thru lane if your employees just ignore it like what happened tonight. Also while they have security inside the pan handlers in the drive thru lanes at night are out of control.

"I usually frequent McDonald's at least once a week, whether its to grab a coffee or get some pancakes for my little one. This visit was probably the worst I've experienced. I ordered my food at 9:11AM - A mcgriddle, a coffee, and two hashbrowns. Once I paid I was immediately told to go to #1, so I did. After waiting until 9:30AM with no one in the drive thru line anymore I went back around where a female with red hair came walking out with a guy who looked like they knew each other. After handing me my bag, I asked about my drink and she said ""What drink"", I said the coffee that's listed on the ticket you provided me along with the receipt. She said okay and then CONTINUED to hold a conversation with the guy standing right in front of me. I waited an additional 2 minutes and she was still talking and laughing with the guy while me, a customer was watching her and patiently waiting for my coffee. Needless to say, my patience went thin and I told her to forget about it and I had to leave. I paid for something I never received and was treated with the most disrespect in my book.

Among other things, we ordered 3 orders of 20 nuggets, 4 large fries, a bunch of dbl cheeseburgers and a quarter pounder. Know what we got? A drink we didn't order, an apple pie we didn't order, an ice cream we didn't order, and one 10 piece nugget. In a big bag that looked enough like one that would hold our order - our bad, I guess, but our not checking closely enough just doesn't excuse just not getting 40+ $ worth of food.

I told them it has been almost 20 minutes and to please hurry, another 10 minutes went by and I had to go back to work, I left with-it my food and without my coffee which is really why I went there.

"I usually give high reviews but not this time. The service is excellent. Fast and professional staff all the way. Truely representing McDonald's culture. Unfortunately there is an issue with homeless people that brings this location down. The restroom has a bad odor because of the homeless people washing up in there. The restroom door doesn't close as to see what's going on in there such as drug use I can only speculate. There are plenty of homeless people going in and out of the establishment to eat and use the restroom. So they carry a bad odor. It ruins the atmosphere. It's depressing. I witnessed a homeless man get hauled out by Santa Monica Police for lounging around, not purchasing any food, and being loud and unruly. I applaud the quick response of the security officer on duty who immediately asked the man to leave several times always maintaining his composure, even as the homeless man escalated. It's a tough job, but it's getting done. The priorities are kept here. Customer satisfaction and safety are key to the staff and it shows.",3 stars,3,0

First 2 out of my last 3 breakfast orders were wrong. But didn't realize until I got to work. I cannot leave my job to go back.
Then today I got a steak, egg, and cheese bagel. Which was right with the exception of 2 long black hairs in it.
I stopped back on my way home and asked for a manager.
The first manager only asked for a receipt. She then left and got another manager. She was a heavy set black woman. She was the most ignorant, vile person that I've ever dealt with. Not even an apology. Her response was to bring it back? 5 hours later? When I said that was ridiculous, she closed the window and walked away. I asked for a corporate phone number and she refused.
I called and I can only assume it was the same ignorant woman because she put the phone down and left it off the hook.
I called again for the phone number and she said its on my receipt and hung up.
She is clearly incompetent and doesn't deserve her jib.
Funny thing is I didn't ask for anything free! An I'm sorry may have been enough.

Ordered mobile and it took over 30 minutes for my order and I watched everyone standing in line to order get ignored for 20 minutes at a time. Which, after reading reviews seems like it is the norm to wait 30 minutes for a single mcgriddle.
After I waited over 30 minutes for my order, they forgot my drinks (which I waited at the counter for another 5 minutes before anyone even asked what I needed) and my order was wrong. But I wasn't about to sit another half hour for them to remake a different sandwich. Not a big deal.

"For a prime, busy, tourist filled location, the processes and procedures at this McDonalds are absolutely terrible.  Many of the self-ordering machines do not work, when you use a normal line with a cashier, it's like the employees have never even been to a McDonald's before as they don't even know the menu items (I ordered traditional chicken nuggets meal, so it wasn't pasta, or some sandwich that only special locations have).  When you order at a kiosk, you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream.  Then you wait 15+ minutes to find out they don't have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one, which she doesn't know how to do so you end up paying $4+ for a cup of ice cream.  I did get my money back for the ice cream because I couldn't believe it took that long.

Worst McDonald's I've ever been to the people do not speak English a good majority of them and so they will not even try to answer your question they just walk away and ignore you they are not open 24 hours that is a lie it says confirmed by the company but that is not true as they were closed at 6:00 a.m. and said they don't open till 7:00 a.m. although their door says open 24 hours that's a lie and if you knock on the door they just ignore you the most ignorant McDonald's employees I have ever encountered.,1 star,1,0
This is a very very very busy location. They only have one register open and they want to push you to using the kiosks. So for a fast-food you stand there waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting to take your order then waiting waiting waiting waiting to get your food no longer fast food you might want to think about going somewhere else. Also they're doing nothing with the homeless with your kind of occupying most seats. Very disappointing but I blame this on corporate because corporate needs to get involved.,3 stars,3,0
"It's in a bad part of town. A lot of homeless and panhandlers. Bathroom are locked, security watches you... it's an uncomfortable feeling. Not really a good place to take the kids for dinning in. But their service is okay and quick. Their food is standard McDonald's service. Nothing special about it. And this McDonald's sometimes Jack's up their prices cause they say they're ""downtown"" which to me means nothing but everything downtown costs more. McDonald's should not cost more ...",3 stars,3,0

"I was glad to hear McDonald's lowered their coffee & frappe prices & they were having a special sale. I had to repeat a simple two step iced coffee order SEVERAL times. The drive thru worker was distraught as I gave back 1st one made wrong. Another employee finished order, by running out to car. I questioned the workers about the cost & size of my drink (all 3 said it was med size - turned out to be a SMALL) & they ""got me"" a few weeks ago on that. Girl who ran out order was ONLY ONE who acted professionally & provided great customer service. SADLY, the iced coffee prices are low because drink is so small, if they could charge a fair price they would have a new regular! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿",2 stars,2,0

"Incredibly slow service, sat in the drive-thru for at least 10 minutes without the line moving. When I finally got my food, the crispy chicken sandwich tasted stale, the texture was very chewy and not crisp at all; on top of that, I wasn't asked if I wanted any ketchup or sauces, the sandwich didn't have a drop of mayonnaise or anything on it, just oddly dry pickles, and a soggy bun. I had to park and go inside to get condiments. As has become almost expected with the McDonald's experience, the soda tasted like sanitizer. Never again at this location.

Back to the self help machines, it states that they will bring you the drink to your table. They brought me the food but told me to get the cup up front. I don't really care but someone should change what the machine states.

You must order on a kiosk which is easy enough until you get to the end where it tells you to grab a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½table tentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and input the number.

The counter staff were so busy they talked around me to other customers. I waited my turn and finally got to ask for a number for my dine in order, the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½table tent.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½  The counter guy looked at me like I was speakt me the order in less than 10 minutes, about half the time I wasted on the first try.
As I sat waiting for my order I watched 3 people in a row return their drinks because it was the wrong drink.  Maybe a cascade effect, you get one out of order and the next few also get the wrong drink.  As for me, I also got the wrong drink.

Manager Jennifer was rude and said that if I wanted to do it with a cashier I had to do it via drive thru. To be honest, that is totally disrespectful and unprofessional.

The employee was as stunned as I and ask why and in an Arrogant voice. She said ""its because we GOTZ ( gotz) to clean the machine"" Well I felt this was rude and followed up with a question to this woman. I asked,  what if I get here at 21:45 and ask for a milkshake. She again in an Arrogant voice responded with, "" you aintz getting it"" ( aint'z) ( The rest of the staff laughed when she made this comment)
After all this and being made to wait 15 minutes for my order, I requested a refund and to speak to the manager. I was told by this woman that no manager was available.
So I went back the next day to report this incident, I ask the front customer representative to speak with a manager. Oddly enough, she directed my attention to the woman that I had this encounter with the night before.
So not only did I get HORRIBLE customer service in a language and tone that was less than professional, I was lied to as the customer service rep..AKA Manager Nicky was available the whole time.

"This is the most disorganized Mc Donalds I have been to in my life. They are the slowest, most unprofessional and disrespectful one that I have ever seen. I live at the corner, so I did not have a single experience. It was multiple ones, and it is always the same terrible service. Once I had to wait 30 minutes for a simple and 'should be quick' coffee. But the last time I went there was the worst. I stayed around 20 minutes in the counter and nobody was capable to ask me if was in need of something. I was picking an order up, which took me almost 1 hour (20 minutes until somebody talked to me + 30 minutes waiting for the food). They are just always so messy that from now on every time I want to eat a burger, I consider first going to Wendy's or Jack in the Box, or another Mc Donalds store... not this one anymore",1 star,1,0

Whoever their trainer is should be ashame when they have the McDonald's conference in Orlando Florida. If I could give them negative stars I would.

"Believe me when I say, I love McDonald's, but this particular restaurant is truly dreadful.
Waited 30 minutes for my first (and very probably last) spicy chicken sandwich (photo attached). You'd think with taking that amout of time it would at least resemble the menu picture in some small way, but no.
They ALMOST managed to get some sauce in there. Slightly more would have helped disguise the taste of the burnt brioche bun! I ate it for 3 reasons 1) I was hungry 2) I didn't want to wait a further 30 minutes to be served up another sad, burnt offering and 3) the dead eyes of the staff threatened to haunt my dreams for all eternity and I just couldn't face the soulsucking experience of trying to explain my disappointment to them when they were all clearly in their own personal hells.
Take my advice, if you decide to run the gauntlet of a late evening visit to this restaurant, order the pasta, not a burger, it's pretty decent if you have at least 30 minutes to wait for it. Otherwise, do yourself a favour and wander on to one of the many other restaurant choices in this part of iDrive. Wish I had!",1 star,1,0

We were given over seasoned  fries, one straw for three drinks, and the drinks were all bad.
I thought how do you mess up a drink?
It is my belief that this was attributed to the mistake that was made with coffee order wanted moca frap was given hot coffee.
She took all drinks back and brought tray back with correction.
It tasted like instead of coffee mixture it was blended with old filtered out deposits, I mean really sour.
The manager however corrected the moca and recooked fries.

If you order to go use a kiosk because eating in could take a while because a server has to walk the food over. They have a pastry cafe and the play area is massive.

The associate, instead of been polite, talked to us in a not too pleasant tone. I did not wanted to make things worst so we placed our order and moved on to pay and pick up.

One of my worst experiences at a McDonalds ever.   I waited in a line at the drive through for 20  minutes.  Get to the first window where I hand them my card and end up paying for someone else's order.   Waited longer to correct that situation.  The order at the window was wrong.  Waited some more for that to be corrected.  Finally the lid to my soda wasn't on so when I went to grab it in the car the lid popped off the cup and spilled all over me.,1 star,1,0

I was flat out refused service one time because I walked to this place and needed to go through the drive through.
I have a perfectly working car but use that time to exercise by walking down there.
I'm also asked at least twice before and twice after I get my food for money every single time I to there by people asking for a hand outs. Its very uncomfortable. That is not an exaggeration either. Can't the security who work there try protecting your customers from being harassed instead of being on their cell phone all the time?

I live near this new location and have visited 6 times since the remodel, and I've concluded that this location is a 120% mess. If all of my orders are wrong I can imagine thousands of others are driving off with incorrect purchases. I ask for no cheese every time, and guess what is in my order.. CHEESE. Or my frys are half full, or the hashbrowns are completely missing, no syrup/ utensils are in the bag as requested. On 3 occasions we were told to pull ahead and park on the side while they remake my order, an employee brings out an incorrect order.. yes 3 times. Today this ""New"" team member blatantly tells me to go in and take of it... what the hell? Every other time I let the incorrect order slide, but today I decided to speak with the store manager. I let her know politely about all of my incorrect orders, and she replies ""Sorry"", I then ask ""what is mcdonalds doing about this, its every time the order is wrong?"" She responds ""I'm so sorry""... I ask again and same response.  Meanwhile the woman next to me is asking about the replacement order that she put in ten minutes ago, they apologize to her and say they are going to reinput it.... this new location is a joke, its truly insane that a Mcdonalds is operating like this, and its been a few months since their brand new building opened.",1 star,1,0

Not good, new construction is nice. But understaffed. Even at 2-3am you can walk in and find over half of the tables covered with trays and garbage. Also the floors heavily littered. Yes you are supposed to buss your own table at a fast food restaurant, but alot of foreign/domestic vacationers are just filthy. They just drop food and wrappers everywhere. When they are done eating they just get up and leave.
Host/busser is needed for the dining area for the sloppy pigs. More register coverage for the guests. When a crowd of people have to go through one register while the kitchen staff waits for orders is inefficient.
I have had 2-3 errors in my 8 visits. First one was when they put extra mustard on burger instead of adding mayo. Second was they ran out of hot fudge and instead of telling me they used the coffee chocolate topping for my Sunday's (yes 2 of them).
I caught the first error quickly and was easily fixed properly by management before I left. The 2nd error wasn't caught till we where eating the Sunday's at home. I took one back as proof of the error to get a refund. At first they only wanted to refund one but with several minutes of bickering they refunded both. Yeah it was only $1 and some change but it was the principal.
I walk to and from the restaurant since I have no car it is about one mile away from my home. I always request 2 plastic bag's for my food because the one paper bag they put my 6-8 burgers fails halfway home. The 2nd one is for the 3 Sunday's.

Another epic failure, ordered 2 mcdouble no mustard and onions. 2 bacon mcdouble  and 2 mcdouble regular. Received the 2 mcdouble wo/mustard and onions no problem. 2 bacon mcdouble had no bacon and no mustard fail. 2 regular mcdouble had no mustard either fail. 2 large fries ordered and received 2 medium sized fries and 2 of the smallest sized fries I've ever seen (guess they where kids sized) fail. The 20 peice fry came without incident. Less than 1/2 of the whole order came correctly....

"Terrible! Ordered an artisan grilled chicken sandwich and this is what I got. Old soggy lettuce. So that tells me the person preparing the sandwich just didnt care or that this restaurant does not care about keeping fresh items in their kitchen. $8 for this meal to get home just to throw out this sorry excuse for a sandwich. And this was after I had to go BACK through the drive through a second time because my son's happy meal was missing the fries. I mean isn't there a screen that shows what should go in the bags before handing to the customer? And after the second time through I got home to that trash sandwich and they also forgot the sauce for the nuggets, even through I saw it on my receipt so they knew I wanted it, and hot cakes without butter. Just carelessness on all fronts at this location. Oh and when I got to the pick-up window I told the woman I have a boy so please put a boy toy in the happy meal, and she said all of our toys are unisex. I will include a picture of his ""unisex"" toy. Take the time and drive pass to the next McDonalds along your route.",1 star,1,0

They have new self serve order kiosks but they are very difficult to navigate. They are not very intuitive at all. My order took three times as long to be brought out. Good idea on the kiosks but very poor execution.

"Absolutely the slowest service I've ever had at a fast food restaurant.  Me and my 3 friends went and we all used the kiosk to order our individual meals.  After 45 minutes and having to talk with the manager we finally got our food.  There was one person working fries, one cook, on manager assisting the cook, and one employee who was supposed to be putting the orders together and delivering to the customers.  The last person walked around like a zombie who had no idea what planet they were even on.  He would pick up a bag occasionally and put it back down and the clear orders from the system and not give anything to the customers. Then when customers complained he would ask them what they ordered and the try to find food for the. After seeing that 3 customers who ordered 20+ minutes after me and my friends I asked to speak with the manager. He proceeded to lie and said that once and order has been on for a while the automatic delete off the que.  So he had no idea what any of us ordered. We had to give him a receipt and the he helped us 10 minutes later. All the trash cans were over flowing into the floor and the restaurant was very dirty.   All the employees including the manager didn't even look 18 years old. They were definitely under trained, mis managed, and probably under staffed.",1 star,1,0

The Food.
We tried pizza and, surprisingly, it was pretty good having in mind it came from the fast food chain. Touch screen menu had enough options of ingredients to customize pizza order based on personal taste. Keep in mind that some toppings cost extra. I would rate pizza 7-8 points out of 10.

"The automated kiosks are horrible.
This store is supposed to be fully automated.. but that's probably the reason why it just doesn't work.   McDonalds should really look into the process and solve it. The workers are at the mercy of inferior technology.

I go into McDonalds and am instructed to use the kiosks.

There are some that aren't working.. some that are working.  A customer instructs me not to use the one I'm facing because it's broken.  Instead.. I use the one on the other side.

The process of ordering on the kiosk is slow and cumbersome.  I have a coupon which I wanted to use.  I first add the item.. then scan the coupon.. VOILA... double order.  Okay.. my bad for not understanding the system.  So now I have to remove the item... I add another item.. and it takes me to the cart for some reason and says ""Is this all I want?""

So I add some more things and finalize my order.  I try to check out, but I have no way to edit my order to select to go.  Okay.. no big deal.. I'll just choose a table... and VOILA.. ERROR.. Please see a cashier.

I talk to the McDonalds attendant and he tells me that he could find my order and that I can pay up front.

During this time.. I see and here about 3-4 people sadly yelling at the McDonalds workers for messing up (really.. it's this automated system that doesn't work... not the people.)

McNuggets were okay.  They were warm.. but were on the verge of being dry.
Fries were okay... looked like they were out for awhile.. (and they didn't fill it to the top).
Soda... this was good.

A very busy McDonald's! Whay under staffed! One young man seemed to be doing all the work involving the food. While they left a inexperienced young lad on the register. She told me my daughter could not have a Dr. Pepper cause it was not a drink choice for the cheeseburger meal. This sounded absurd so when I asked her to explain this she told me no we are just out of it. She was supper sweet and at this point I came to realize only her and the other young man were the only 2 working. As the manager sat there holding a mop and did literally nothing for 20 min.

I always check my food right then and there because this location usually messes up drive though orders , and  when I showed them  the employee gave me a attitude and rolled their eyes at me . She even tried to say the fries fell out of the box into the bag . I showed her the bag being empty ,and even made the comment. Even no ketchup.

The Santa Monica location is on par with most McDonald's out there. The food was satisfactory and the speed of service was reasonable. My only problems with the experience were the restaurant was incredibly busy and the smell of pot was pretty strong from someone smoking it out on the patio. They had the munchies I guess.,4 stars,4,1
"This McDonalds sucks. They recently had a remodel which means the inside is nice and they have the fancy double drive-thru, but unfortunately the remodel could not fix the main issue with this McDonalds: The management.

The management is either not training employees properly or teaching them to bend the rules to keep a good drive-thru timer, because you will always have to pull up at this McD's. Always. Even for perfectly reasonable orders at perfectly reasonable times (1 burger + fry at 3pm = pull up next to the 3-4 other cars already there).

The one manager I've had the displeasure of dealing with was rude as well. I had to go back due to them forgetting several items on an order (that I had to pull up and wait for more than 5 minutes for, no less) and decided I just wanted it refunded to my card. The manager was rude about refusing to put it back on the card and insisting on giving me cash. The best part? He made me pull up to get the cash.

So again: Mis-managed, terrible McDonalds. It's a franchise for a reason, this one just stinks.",2 stars,2,0

"Really frustrated with this location. I usually go to the location off of Beach street and order the same thing every time I go there. I know exactly how much my order should be. I stop here because I happened to be closer to this location than to my normal one and order my usual. 2 McDoubles. I had just enough change in my wallet to pay for my order. Or so I thought. Instead of paying $1.50 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 2 + .25 = $3.25, I was charged $1.99 for ONE Mcdouble. It may not seem like much, but to someone who is on the go and on a budget I expect ome of the biggest fast food chains to at the very least be consistent with their prices. I wonder how much I've over paid at this location in the past!
What made me most upset was that I didnt recieve a receipt for my order. So in order to determine why I paid $2.15 after tax for ONE Mcdouble, I went inside to the self ordering in the lobby and looked it up myself. I dont appreciate not being told my total at the speaker, not beinzing I didnt even receive one to begin with when I pulled forward from the pick up window. It should be standard procedure to give a receipt for the sake of the overpaying customers.",1 star,1,0

"One of the world's largest and most interesting McDonald's. Located in the busy area right in the hub of Orlando off of iDrive.

This is a two-story McDonald's hosting some of the world's rarest menu items including both pasta and pizza and a ton of cakes and other amazing trees.

A great place to visit if you're looking for something fun and interesting in Orlando. If you're a fan of McDonald's, this is the one you're going to want to check out. Although it is always very busy because it is in the downtown tourist hub right near Universal Orlando, I drive, and many other great tourist destinations.

This McDonald's features both counter service and has multiple kiosks of available so you can go up and order easily. There is a drive-thru available.

This is currently the only place in the world serving McPizza with several options available as well as customizations. This is also one of three places in the world including the Philippines and Italy that are currently serving McDonald's pasta. Definitely an interesting menu item to try out if you're looking for something a little different. They also have a full ice cream and cake shop with plenty of dessert choices.

Upstairs host a full gaming arcade with air hockey, skiball, arcade games, and a ticket area to collect prizes once you're all done.

If you're looking for an interesting affair and a little bit of a different McDonald's experience, this is the place to visit.",5 stars,5,1

Then I just get the cup so why ask me? One day, I leave the locator number on table while I go bathroom. Locator and food is gone. Takes me a while to get it sorted out.forgets my drink {again)

One sauce dispensor just explodes pop knocks the container out of my hand under strong pressure. Gets little sauce on my clothes, not too bad but Jesus Christ...

I would rate it a 1 star but people would not take my review seriously. I visited this restaurant last night. It was very clean including the bathroom. At this time there was one cashier with a huge line and a bunch of people waiting for their order. The cashier was overloaded and the manager told everyone to order at the kiosks and not the register. This wasn't possible because nobody could pay at the kiosk; they had to get a receipt and pay at the register. I left 20 minutes later and went to Wendy's when the line had barely moved.,2 stars,2,0

"We were going to the Children's museum & my granddaughter wanted McDonald. Apparently at this location they will only take your order in the drive-thru. We had to call over the counter for help.

They told me that I still needed to order from the kiosk & then pay cash at the counter...what...then why won't they just take my order??? Then we had to call over the counter a 2nd time because we were struggling with the kiosk. The lady that came out said I had to order my meal a la carte...what!!! Needless to say, we walked out & will  NEVER return!!! If it's such an inconvenience to take people's orders inside maybe they should close the lobby at this location & only have the drive-thru.

I tested it and it was not right so I waited to get to work and put one more splenda thinking they had not put the right amount. Drank about half when I noticed the sticker. That coffee affected my health because of the sugar! Their is kore but why bore you. Hope they change.,3 stars,3,0

Manager Priscilla calls me to apologize and invites me back with my family, I explained I cannot come back next day, but would come following Sunday, she agreed and hung up. On Sunday I come to the restaurant and there is another manager Cynthia who I explained the situation and she grunted the whole time she took the order. While on the service line, she tries to contact the manager and right there from behind the line, she asks me yelling, what is your name, I tell her and again in front of EVERYONE, other customers included, yells again, ""she tells me you came in already!!"" I replied NO, at this point I'm embarrassed and upset and I hear her that she tells the person on the phone I already put it down. Twenty minutes later, I finally get the order. I ask her to change the fries on some of the things that were ready because they were cold. The manager grunts and agrees to. After my family were done with their meals, we had ordered ice cream and we asked to hold off until we were done. When we returned, we asked for the ice cream and we had asked for chocolate, they said that we had ordered vanilla and the manager gave us one less of what we ordered. Incredible! Bottom line, we were invited to come back to make it up for bad service and McDonald's came through, we got yelled at by the manager, embarrased, long wait for food, missing food items, and pissy attitude by staff.

"Most unprofessional and rude mcdonalds I have ever been to.
I recently went to this Mcdonalds and order 2 quarter pounders with cheese with no ketchup or tomatoes because I have an allergy and a large coke. When I got to work I'm happy that I checked it before I bite into it because it had both. When I called them and spoke to the manager I was asked my name and to come back and they would replace it. I couldn't make it back that day because I was at work so I called the next day and left them know my name and I was going to go by and get the replacement and they said that I was ok to pick it up. Not even 5 minutes later the manager called me back and told me that I couldn't go pick it back up. When I said the manager said it was OK the person that called me back said it was a different manager that I talked to and thistles manager said absolutely not. Which it was the same manager.

Unfortunately for me my husband picked up dinner for me from there and I very Unfortunately didn't specify which one to go to... although this one is closest to home I will drive all the way to Altamonte to avoid it, and the way gas prices are that should tell you all you all need to know. Tonight it was missing fries (we ordered a total of 6 whole items so I can see how that was overwhelming to this bunch) and freezing cold fries which I have no idea how you can even do since even if it been under the warmer for a while... stone cold fries? I wouldn't put it past them they kept them on a counter somewhere instead though. And on top of that I made the mistake of asking for extra pickles on my big mac which I'm sure put this kitchen in a frenzy so they just threw all the ingredients in the box so I can do my own assembling of it... which was probably for the best because who knows what chaos it would cause for them to assemble it.

Sometimes high tech doesn't mean faster. Location has multiple self service kiosk meaning instead of taking orders one at a time you have several being made simultaneously. Causing a backup waiting to get food inside while competing with drive-thru. Location still does not offer dining inside after ordering food. They had just mopped with 20+ customers inside so that was a safety hazard. Not to mention I overheard someone tell one of the employees that something was broke in the ladies restroom causing water on the floor.,1 star,1,0

"I've been going to this location most of my life since it's not far from my home. So I've seen this McDonald's go through a lot of changes. The employees here generally have decent attitudes, there are a few that tend to be rude. The store is also dirty a lot of the time. It's a very busy location, and maybe it's from having a lot of foot traffic, but the floor is usually dirty, the drink station will be filthy and wet and sticky, the ketchup area will be out of ketchup, and/or there will be ketchup all over the place, too. The tables tend to be dirty, too, you usually have to clean off your own table. Also they have those light up tables that kids like, and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting there, and they won't be eating, and they'll have their stuff all over the place and sit there for hours. And mind you, these tables seat about 8 and there will be one homeless person sitting there. My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the lights, and I'll have to tell him he can't because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest table, is camping there. The employees don't seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for hours, but buying anything. Sometimes they'll even be sleeping at the table.
The kid's play area is also really crappy. They have nothing for the kids to play on like a playplace. They have 4 of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work properly, or at all. When I was a kid they had a huge playplace, which they took out when they remodeled the store. It even had N64's at one point, along with the playplace. But they took it all out and replaced it with a ""sitting"" place instead of a playplace. It's really awful.
So, all in all, this McDonald's is dirty, has a lot of homeless people that practically live there, and isn't really kid friendly. The food is okay, as long as it's hot food (I get a lot of cold food or my order is wrong), and the employees are generally friendly, but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather lackluster, meaning that you can tell they don't want to be there. This location needs a lot of work. And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in there. There hasn't been a single time I've gone there that there wasn't at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit at, with all their dirty things sitting on the table itself. The table is by the front counter, too and you can often times smell the homeless person that's sitting there the whole time you're waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your drinks. It is not kid friendly at all at this store. With the store being in a nicer part of town you'd expect quite a bit more cleanliness.",2 stars,2,0

I'll only add that this particular McD's suffers from being next door to one of the largest homeless encampments in LA.  Be prepared to be asked (usually politely) by a transient for food.

They didn't give a receipt then told me to go park to wait for the food to be ready.  There were no spots open that I could access and the cashier just said 'do whatever' and walked away.  I waited for the car in front of me to move so I could pull around the building and get into a spot but asked first about my shake.  She said they'll bring it.

I had to place my order with another cashier ( who was sufficient) My food was thrown into a bag and shoved at me by another crew member. All of the food was cold and the sweet tea tasted of coffee grounds. All of the tables were dirty and sticky. Having dined in and watched this gross misconduct happen to several guest. Having been a former Manager of a McDonald's it was a duty to share this experience with your company.

"Ok, here goes... I stopped into the location on Rt73 in west Berlin NJ  for lunch today. The drive through line was super long so I parked and went I side. I ordered a number 5 (artisan chicken sandwich) meal. I paid, waited like 15 minutes, they called my number and I brought my ticket to the counter and took my bag. I got to work and found out I didn't get a chicken sandwich but instead I got a big mac. Which normally wouldn't be an issue but I hate big macs, I've gotten sick eating one before and ever since I can't even look at a big mac without getting sick to my stomach. Needless to say I wasn't happy. I threw the bag in my car and went on with the rest of my work day... on the way home I stopped back in and brought the bag of food back to McDonald's. The manager named Rebecca came to the counter and I told her what happened and I showed her all of the food I got and explained to her what I was supposed to get.(keep in mind I didn't even touch a fry) She was super rude to me and said she can't do anything because I didn't save my receipt. I don't know about anyone else but I always hand my ticket in when they call my number to prove that it's my food they're handing out. And I asked her what's the difference between a receipt and the untouched food that I brought back? I asked for a refund because I was no longer hungry, she said no, I asked for a new meal, after 5 minutes of her spouting off why she couldn't make it right, she finally gave in and walked away from me huffing and puffing and yelled to the back ""make an artisan chicken sandwich"" so a couple minutes later someone put a bag with just the sandwich in it on the counter and I asked where the fries were and she said, ""there was nothing wrong with the fries earlier, just the sandwich"" so this miserable poop butt of a manager refused to give me fresh French fries with my sandwich and handed me back the old fries from 6 hours ago. She took this whole interaction so personal and was acting like the money was coming out of her pocket. My final argument was asking her if she thought I was lying and did she think I made the big mac and fries at my house and brought it in to pull one over on her? What a horrible experience. It sucks when you get 30 minutes for lunch and you're starving and wind up not being able to eat and it's someone else's fault. You want someone to make it right. Instead this manager who gets to use her little bit of power to make up her own rules and make it difficult for you. Like it would of ruined her entire life to fix their error and make it right. It just sucked, I'll NEVER go back there just because of her. And I hope no one else will either. That's how pissed if this whole mess made me...",1 star,1,0

"A disappointing visit. We ordered using the kiosk since no one was manning the counter cash register. We waited over 20 minutes for 3 standard combo meals and no one else was inside the restaurant. The people working in the back only worked on drive thru orders. While waiting, we watched as they cleared our order off the monitor without having served it. At that point, I asked one of the employees why our order was cleared and he responded that he didn't realize it hadn't been served. We were the only people in the restaurant and we were clearly waiting at the counter for something, whether it was food or a condament or napkins and they never even bothered to ask what we needed or what we were waiting for. The staff completely ignored us until we asked why our order was cleared without getting anything. They did make our order fresh once we asked for it, which is why I gave more that 1 star for the food. We would not return to this location.",2 stars,2,0

I have observed this for a while now and said nothing.

When I got the order it ONLY had egg. I politely informed the person at the drive through window, but they refused to correct the order, saying in a absolute terms that this is what I ordered and if I wanted what I ACTUALLY ordered I'd have to get back in line and place a new order!!

The drink fountain was closed 'to keep the restaurant clean' according to the sign so I went to the counter and asked for a refill and the manager said ""We don't do refills here"". What? Seriously?

"So, I got to this location frequently, despite hearing the horror stories about this location, because it is close to me. Well, tonight my order was messed up and they yelled at me about it.
First, I tell the person taking my order that I would like a Bacon Double Quarter Pounder w/ Cheese, Tea for the drink, make the combo a large. So, the first thing we have a discussion about is that he gave me an unsweetened tea on the screen. I tell him I would like a sweet tea for the drink, and he tells me that I ordered it wrong. I said, ""Well, normally when I come here, they default to sweet tea."" I said that because they usually do  He said, ""Nah! That's not how we do it. Then, he clears the entire order and puts in a Quarter Pounder with Cheese.

I tell him that I ordered a Bacon Double Quarter with Cheese, sweet tea, and make the combo a large. I saw that it was not right on the screen, but he repeated the order to me correctly.  I pulled around to pay for the order and waited on it to be served to me. I checked the order and told the person at the window that it was not a double. The person at the window talked to the person who took my order, and he came to the window and yelled, ""I MADE WHAT YOU ORDERED."" I told him that I said ""double"" several times when I ordered, 5 times to be exact. He person who took my order, who looked to be a manager, yelled at me, ""NO! IT WAS THE WAY YOU ORDERED IT. YOU ASKED FOR A SINGLE.""

I repeated that I asked for a Bacon Double Quarter with cheese and he started arguing with me about how to order sweet tea. He finally told me that he would make it order, but I did not trust him at this point, so I said that I was leaving and I would not be back.

This was an awful experience and I will not be back. I will also tell my friends and family to avoid this location despite that it has served our community over 10 years.",1 star,1,0

All I ordered was 2 mcribs for $6 drive-thru. They asked me to pull into parking lot and wait. Ended up waiting 25 minutes before I got my order. They claimed the manager couldn't find me. It is a very small parking lot. The manager didn't try very hard. I ended up calling them to remind them about my order. They came out with the same mcribs and handed them to me by this time the were slightly warm and very soggy. The only explanation I got was we're so sorry. I just left immediately otherwise I would have lost my cool if I stayed. Ended up just throwing my order away after one bite. Lost my appetite.,1 star,1,0

This is supposed to be fast food.

When I went to pick up my order, the drinks were wrong, the potatoes were the wrong size and old, the Sundae machine was broken, they didn't deliver our sundaes and the attendance was super rude, saying that the problem was mine and not hers, burgers were in the correct Double Quarter Ponder box but when we got home, there were cheeseburgers and the third burger wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t in the bag!!

Was basically out of half the menu. Then we had them repeat back our $56 dollar order to us twice and once we got back to our hotel 2 sandwiches were missing. While paying with my card through the drive thru the cashier said I had to give her my pin number because the pad didn't reach out the window. I've NEVER had something like that happen to me anywhere in my life. Not a single employee had on a uniform. Just a total messed up experience,1 star,1,0
"I used the McD's mobile app for the first time. There was a ""deal"" available through the McD's app that was a great value & fit what I enjoy at McD's (occaisionally). Everything processed for the order... once I succeeded in completing the order with small amount of difficulty. Checked my account two days later as part of semi-weekly review. The McD's mobile ordering double charged me for the order. They processed two charges for the one order. When rhe corporate McD's was contacted they apologized, stated the program has occasional quirks (being worked out), and told me I needed to drive out of my way to go back to the store to get my money back. After explaining that they would have to reimburse my time and expenses to do their legwork in correcting their error of stealing my money AND explaining that they simply review their detail processing report of electronic charges for the two transactions (I provided the actual transaction info for date, time, #'s etc) they agreed to process the charge reversal.... because they WOULD NOT reimburse my time/expenses to return to get my refund of money they stole out of my account. After considerable time and insistence on my part, the manager agreed and reviewed the transactions report, verified the double billing, and assured the charge will be reversed. I got a follow up call from the area manager for McD's who turned out to be VERY unprofessional and rude in her attitude and handling if the matter. She actually admitted she hung up on me when I was reprimanding her on her shortcomings for not listening to what I was saying and continually speaking loudly over me, while I was speaking. Interesting..... is this how McD's is improving the bottom line, by stealing? NO ONE at McD's, even after explaining the process to correct an improper charge, had a clue how to address or willingness to pursue. They directly stated it was on me. I had to come back to a store, out of my way, to get a refund of my money, that they improperly seized from my account. Unbelievable as that is for my 1st mobile order/purchase experience w/McD's they were excited I used it and recommended I try the mobile order system again soon. Yeah right..... I'm gonna use a system with a 100% failure rate (my experience) and that they have no knowledge of how to process system failures, that do occur to their admission & knowledge. Horrible experience in all regards. Clearly rolled out the program with known links and poor or no training in corrective measures when incurred.",1 star,1,0

The automated machine didn't print us a receipt so I told one of the employees who was nice enough to look up the number.  The problem was I had no reference to chek the order.  I spent almost 50 dollars for 3 kids and 2 adults.  I walked 5 blocks to get that food bbn order and when I got back to our job I discovered we were missing chicken nuggets and all the dipping sauces.  I ordered 6 sauces and we got none.  It really pisses me off because they always leave stuff out when we order large orders.  It's like they can only handle it if u have a simple meal.  It's so frustrating and plus it's like throwing 10.oo out the window..  you really need to be better about training your workers.,2 stars,2,0

Pizza also came first, (table delivery) and advised remainder of the order would be delivered shortly. Had to then ask again after around 15 minutes. Order was quickly brought but believe this would have been forgotten if we had not asked. Overall good was fine, but service poor due to being so busy!",3 stars,3,0

The customer service was what I would expect given the employees having to deal with the distractions from the crowd of people inquiring about their order.

* Customers can look up at the monitors above the counter to see the process of their order.

The average gluttonous ""starving"" American that eats at McDonald's behaves as though their needs are of paramount importance. It's one of the best examples you can witness of bloated self-entitlement.

This has to be the worst McDonalds! The food is never hot and never fresh.  I went there again tonight since it's the only place open.   The fries were warm and tasted like they had been cooked in an air frier and the burger was cold and tasted like it had been sitting for hours.

Also told me that the payment had not come through and I requested to cancel the order but, 3 minutes later I was charged with the order that I never got so, Im  making this complain because I am pretty upset and disappointed because I always eat in Mc.

"I visited this establishment as the kfc over the road was a let down like no other.
Only pro here was that I got what I actually ordered however what a game trying to order it.
The lady was not listening at all and just started adding anything and everything to my order.
She was ruder then my explicit Eminem album and when I finally got to sorting out my order it was awful.. My chicken nuggets tasted like chewing on the chickens feet fresh out of the pen.
My Apple pie was questionable to if it was even a pie or not.
They only gave me bbq sauces, like who doesn't want ketchup ???
The best thing about the meal was driving out of the establishment never to look back again.

Having worked for mcdonalds in the past, I know for a FACT it takes just a little over 2 minutes to fry a full basket of fries (which leads 3 large fries).

"One of my favorite features of McDonald's for me is that I know what I can expect; offerings, flavors, etc.
This is true for this particular restaurant, however, it seems that being soooo busy (I guess excellent location) makes them impervious to concerns about customer service or satisfaction of their customers.

Running out of lettuce, running out ""of many things"", are management/logistics problems. Bad attitude, lack of courtesy, well I guess that problem is on us, the customers, right?

"A worker called MY order number so obviously I'm gonna grab it. It didn't even occur to me to look at the tray the only thing I noticed was that I was missing a coffee so I set the tray on the table and on my way back I see the manager yelling at my family about how WE grabbed the wrong order and see at first we tried being cool about it. She said she was taking back the extra food and we said that was fine so then she starts grabbing the food we ordered and says we weren't charged for that, after an interesting conversation we establish that my receipt clearly said I was charged. Ten minutes later they've manned to give two BIG orders but haven't managed to give me a bacon egg mcgriddle. So eventually I get the burger and as the manager hands it to me she's telling a worker she gave us 8 hash browns. I obviously heard her and said ""no ma'am, we got 4"" this same manager then has the audacity to say we already ate them. At this point I'm pissed. I've been accused of not paying for my part of the food, I'm hungry, I've waited way too long, the manager has an attitude, AND she's a accusing my family of eating 4 hash browns in less than a minute. NEVER eating at this McDonald's again. Especially with a manager like that.",1 star,1,0

They have the basic dollar menu - sweet tea, apple pies, apple dippers, cone and some other things, but too bad they don't have the chicken sandwich or McDouble for a dollar. The seating area can get packed sometimes and they don't always open the third floor to the public, although it really doesn't fit that many people, but sometimes you would have to wait a while for someone to finish before you can get a table and seat.",3 stars,3,0

He was originally on the side and took over the register from one of his coworkers on purpose with the intent of being completely racist to them. He spoke with an Asian accent ridiculing their race and telling them he can serve them for an extra $5.00. While this was happening, all of the other employees laughed and egged him on.

The service is nice and there are plenty of places to sit down to eat. Be careful leaving the parking lot though as international drive (the road) is pretty interesting at times.

The grease from the burger had absorbed into the bread so much that I squeezed the bread and grease dripped from it. The frys were not at all fresh. I threw my meal in the trash where it belonged. Called the store and spoke with John. He apologized and took my name down and I will get a refund but it doesnt help my hunger NOW. Worst encounter with McDonalds ever.

"All those renovations in appearance makes no difference if the staff is unprofessional and simply ghetto. Then again it is in Newark smh. I was not aware that this particular Mc Donald's was not a corporate store, honestly I wouldn't know how to differentiate one from the other. In any case to my understanding every Mc Donald's ran the same policy in regards to the food they sell, obviously. So when I go to get my coffee, everyone knows you are entitled for one free refill but to my surprise this Mc Donald's does not honor that. The person at the register who's name is Estella (mexican woman) was the one who took my order and made me feel real uncomfortable and awkward when I asked politely for my refill. There were others on line waiting to take their order and I feel like she deliberately embarrassed me. There was no need to make me feel degraded, at the end of the day I am a customer and I have no need to bring my business here. I should of took my business where I noramlly go which is the one located on Washington Ave, in Belleville. That just goes to show you how true the phrase is, ""Never judge a book by it's cover""!",1 star,1,0

"The worst McDonald's in the area. I have lived close to this McDonald's for a little over a year now and have yet ever had a good experience. My order is either not accurate or the food is unacceptable. Also the team members and management just don't seem  to care. I'm not usually one to complain about things because I do realize this is a fast food restaurant, however this last visit has really ticked me off, I couldn't even place my order because the person taking orders in the drive thru was so incompetent, and then she wanted to act like she couldn't hear me. Other times I have visited this location,  I have had an issue where items were left off my order, so brought the food back to have it all replaced because by the time I got home and had to drive back to pick up my missing items, it would all be cold. I asked for my order to be remade and I legit watched this manager put my sandwich in the microwave ... I could understand if I had a huge order to be replaced but it was honestly 3 items.

They offer a tap menu option and table service. So once your done ordering thru the self tap options you grab a number and have a seat.

We ordered our regular McDonald's food with the addition of a strawberry and banana waffle. Which was bomb.

I did feel like the store was a bit dirty. But it was probably cause it had a rush. After we left it calmed down and the employees were cleaning.

It is on the more expensive side. We ordered two Mcdoubles (which we had a coupon and applied it) large fries, a small drink and the waffle. The total was 19 bucks... It would have been 23... Lol",4 stars,4,1

"This plave is not a good place. They used to have blacks there too. Now all hispanic and trey just remodeled. All of sudden after the remodel all the staff all like the same race. I though McDonald's was equal opportunity employer. Guess not. Today I went there to use the restroom. I was told I couldn't use the restroom unless I bought something. I explained that it was an emergency and I just have to take a number one and I will be on my way. I asked to speak to the manager, the manager told me the same thing you have to buy something. I told the manager I really had to use the restroom it was an emergency I'll be in and out that's all I need it and I was still denied. Every time I come to this place is always something. Things to give me cold food all the time I would ask for fresh food and they would make me wait 20 to 30 minutes I would just wait while standing there looking at her. I wasn't really strong with expressing myself oh, now I express myself a little bit more. I just thought that everybody should know is this place really isn't a nice place to be I wouldn't give them a dime of my money. When did they treat people and I've always treated people is not okay if I was a business owner in a McDonald's along to me I would fire the entire staff shut the McDonald's down and start new with the whole new staff of all Races and ethnicities different religions in different ways of being themselves instead of running it like Fort Knox and no one even speaks English. Not a respectable place and I think a lot of changes need to happen. The last thing that we all need is a petition being signed to shutdown a very nasty, disrespectful, unprofessional in very unreliable restaurant in one of the most popular places in California. Let's get back together McDonald's or else I'll go to the next level and bringing all these customers that also it's like this McDonald's. We even go one more step above and bring the in all your future customers who have never been there before just to mention on how they've had experiences at McDonald's that were so exceptionally great and then compare it to the way that you treat all the customers who've walked out of McDonald's and see if they'll never come back I don't think we want this to be a topic of discussion.",1 star,1,0

They somehow didn't get the fries part and only thought I ordered nuggets and drink (wtf?), even though I had made it very clear that I ordered the meal. Then they tried to charge me an ADDITIONAL $1 for the fries which would have put the total cost OVER the actual price of the meal. I wasn't having any of that bullsh*t and I guess they realized how ridiculous they were being, because they relented pretty quickly and handed over the fries.",1 star,1,0

We drive up to get our food and the person was pleasant enough. The food now left a lot to be desired. French fries were not fresh. They had zero salt. We ordered a 10 piece of chicken nuggets and got eight pieces. Then on top of that they're old and stale and cold. Needless to say we will never be going there again.",1 star,1,0

"I am tired of the inconsistency of this particular establishment. The first thing is that this is the only McDonalds in the area that starts serving breakfast at 3 am. It is next to a club and i am sure a burger sounds better after drinking, but anyway back to the inconsistency. I show up everyday at 2:45 am and sometimes i can get a qtr pounder and other days they say it's not on the late night menu. What really bugs me is that several time I am told breakfast only! No ody shows up at that time for a mcgriddle. Stop being lazy and make the food. Most of the breakfast is ready to slap together and is why they do it, but i show up before 3 am and I want a burger! Why can't the staff get their stuff together as i wrote this review 3 people drove off because they did not want breakfast either.",1 star,1,0

"I was here a couple times during a week. I would say it has been pleasant (service as expected). But man, Saturday was not normal. Trash bins over flowing, tables dirty, self help machines missing table locator, and drink dispenser area was messy. From what I could see, the back looked cleaned but the front of the house was a wreck.

Back to the self help machines, it states that they will bring you the drink to your table. They brought me the food but told me to get the cup up front. I don't really care but someone should change what the machine states.

Overall, this is a modern looking McDonald's. Most of the days I went here it has been good. But I guess their weekend was a different story.",3 stars,3,0

Especially, since the ""dining room"" is no longer open 24 hours.  No drive through. Sad. Literally, steps from the pier. The collective grime of all of Santa Monica resides on this location surrounding sidewalks. The homeless aren't the issue.  It is the mentally disturbed , the hustlers  and questionable addicts.

"3 stars for being a clean and friendly McDonald's but it'll never be a 5 star stop because they NEVER have ice cream. Doesn't matter where you go there's a 90% chance they are out or the machine is down. Morning? Down. Afternoon? Down? Nighttime? Down. Halloween? Down. On Halloween?! Yes, completely down all night. I know that ice cream machines being down is a running joke but this location is the king of it.",3 stars,3,0

Honestly, if you visited every single McDonalds in the country and ranked them I am convinced this one would be dead last.

I have never seen a group of people move so slowly and with such little purpose or interest  in what they were doing. It seems like they were just annoyed to be working at all. Literally it looked like the whole crew was moving in slow motion, it was a sight to see.

Then when I finally did get my food the order it was, of course, not correct. But the weird thing is they didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t short me they gave me an extra quarter pounder and fries.

She was doing nothing but standing there she don't want to take my order and keep telling me use the screen and refuse to help me.i verbally confronted her .there I left without my breakfast. If people like her keep working for your well known establishment you loose and get defame your good name because people like her. Teach her some manners how to behave with people ho come to your restaurant to have good time. She act like I was a homeless person. I hope you can do something about this incident.

"Being that it's the first Mickey D's after you cross into the US from Quï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½bec, Canada, this place gets seriously packed at times with the Canadian tourists. I saw 2 buses stopping in to feed their passengers during my short visit here, on top of the regular customers and/or those that are traveling by cars. Just like those working at Mickey D's over the border in the Canadian side (mainly showing French), these workers only spoke English and weren't too thrilled about French-only customers. I used the app to place my order, which was more convenient and the workers seemed to appreciate that more, since they don't have to deal with extra people face-to-face. My order came out in timely manner (even with tons of tourists flooding in) and the food was good. Staff was friendly as they get. Huge parki",5 stars,5,1

"I want to apologize to anyone that I recommended this particular McDonald's to in the past.
This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks, but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly. At that time, it was worth it. The menu was cheap (or at least what you know to expect from a international chain) and, since it's a chain, you know what the food is gong to be like.
So, let's look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants. You need to set yourself apart with your service. This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant. Sadly, I don't think they care anymore. The last time we went, half of the kiosks weren't working. One of the three that was, didn't print receipts. (This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious. Actually there was a lot that played into it.) Now, if you've gone to McDonald's at all recently, you know you pick your food at the kiosk, get a number that you take to your table, pay at the kiosk, sit down and wait for your food. Typically all of that takes about five minutes. Well, this day (and what I've garnered from tourists and locals, on many other days) the team at work decided they weren't going to bring the food to the table. That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE, but of course that would have been a form of service so that didn't happen. After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together (only a slight exaggeration) we were told by other customers that were leaving that they weren't calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters.
Ok... So I go up to the counter and wait. We get our food 40 minutes later, and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected. No big deal, we are used to this.
My in-laws are visiting and at this point I'm trying to figure why they haven't received their order. It dawned on me  that my father in-law doesn't have a receipt (remember the machine that wasn't printing receipts?).
The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt, not the tent number. Apparently, my in-laws food was ready in a master of minutes (amazing since that is all customized) and placed in the ""abandoned order"" area. If we hadn't said anything, they would never have received their food. The lady never once called a tent number. We told another person of the lack of receipt problem. That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers. When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt, she asked us what the receipt number was. We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine, and she asked again for the receipt.
Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do, the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump. I'm not sure if they just didn't staff well on this shift, but like I said, I've talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while.",1 star,1,0

"Working a graveyard shift in the area, I thought of grabbing a quick bite while on a quick break.

I asked how long it would take, but no answer was given. I asked again, she continued to say it was updating and that she couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t take my order. I finally started putting in a mobile order to make it easier on their end, but she got back on again and rudely said ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ho while their system updated. So I decided to leave to find another place to grab a quick bite, only to hear her say that she did mention they were closed if I were listening to her.

Another driver in the other stall was having the same issue with another male employee, but was actually nice enough to let them know they were temporarily closed until further notice.

Clear unprofessional attitude from this female employee. Definitely needs to be taught better in respect and in having better customer service skills.

"Because it is the largest McDonald, it is a place where you go there so you can scratch off your bucket list.
It is very crowded,  very noisy,  a lot of kids, of course.
They have pizza, coffee, and sweets beside the regular menu.

I think the staff works hard and as fast as they can. In my opinion,  the management has to step in big time in order for this place to run flawsly.

The self order machines two or three didn't work,  so it added to the slow service.
Upstairs is an arcade game room. You need coins. It is very stuffy and even more noisy . But, as I said, a place to visit one's in a love time, so you know you did it!",4 stars,4,1

Manager Jennifer was rude and said that if I wanted to do it with a cashier I had to do it via drive thru. To be honest, that is totally disrespectful and unprofessional.

I pulled forward to place my order at the window and I was told that I had to drive back around. The level of unacceptable is insane.

This by far is one of the coolest McDonald's you will ever go to! It apparently is one of the largest in the world and is 3 to 4 stories tall! It has a special menu that is only designed for this McDonald's specifically which makes it extremely unique.. they have made to order pastas and pizzas.. now I went today at 1:15 in the afternoon in order to pizza and I got it within 15 minutes.. but before warned if you go during a busy time it could take up to 45 minutes.. and unfortunately that is the downfall dislocation is on Sand Lake Road which is in a tourism driven area off of International Drive and it is one of the busiest locations you will ever go to.. if you go during one of these peak times it is unbelievable how busy and how disorganized the location can actually be... but when they are firing on all cylinders it can be a fantastic experience... when you get the pieces or the pastas it is absolutely high and restaurant quality... it's literally amazing to go into a McDonald's for god sakes.. and get restaurant quality food of this caliber.. my pizza is Ace stone Brick Oven fired pizza and it is fantastic! And it was only a little over $11 with tax that is wonderful.. if you're ever in the area you should definitely try it ï¿½ï,5 stars,5,1

The self check out are down and apparently they dont serve lunch till 1100 on Saturday. This whole experience even with the pilot that shares its location was bad. I did call ahead but i got no answer from the pilot. Their showers and laundry is down they're doin construction but the truck parking lot is kinda tight. If a mom and poped open a truck stop around here id give them business. Also this mcdomalds doesnt have indoor dine in due to covid. If you want to be comfortable and sit in a restaurant and eat come to my home state of fl amd get real southern hospitality. We dont live in fear in fl. I didnt think texas had well i leave it at that. They could at least clean the sitting area even though it has caution tape and looms like a crime scene. A little broom and a mop would make a world of difference but the dust that has accumulated out yhere could give a person a cold. Companies really need to start rethinking this covid kick. With resent events people are going to become more conservative with their money. Oils is about to go up and energy pretty muck controls the market. Might be a good time for companies to become more hospitable,1 star,1,0

They're usually quick and the food tends to be accurately prepared.

They deserve it they have proven it to us over and over again..  The New Manager (wish I knew her name) has taken this location from a zero/0 stars to getting a rating of Five/5 Stars and I know that it could not have been easy. I have picked up dinner her once a week for 8-9 weeks in a row and the FOOD has been great.  Thats a lot considering its a McDonald's. My food when I picked it up was always hot, all the food was there correctly. Everything was well made and put together.  You can tell the new manager has set the standards extremely high at this location and the employees have responded extremely well for her. She deserves a big hand for caring about her staff and customers.
Thank You for Caring.......
Great job!!   Well done!!!!!",5 stars,5,1

Stood at the register for about 10 to 12 mins waiting for one of the many employees walking pass me to deliver the orders outside. Once they finally notice me, they took my order. After I waited around another 15 more mins to get my order. I was gonna ask for BBQ sauce but decided I didn't wanna wait an extra 5 mins for that. Overall, this restaurant only prioritize the drive-thru and not the dine-in area. Dine-in area has no cashier available because everyone is focus on drive-thru. So many workers on the front but none on cashier. If your coming here for lunch hour order online or else your lunch hour might turn into only 20 min lunch with all the waiting you'll be doing here.",1 star,1,0

The same manager stood around looking at others needing help during the rush without any movement or intention to step in for her team or their long waiting customers.  The entire place was in disarray from the back to the front with filthy tables, floors, and bathrooms.  Every trash can in the place was overflowing and the pungent smells both in the lobby and the restrooms were enough to make anyone lose their appetite.  Black Friday or not... absolutely unacceptable brazen behavior from management that I would never tolerate under any circumstance from my own team at any level of the company.

They have the doors locked and guys dancing and clowning around. One of them opens the door and tells me they can not take orders in the lobby that drive through is the only way. I asked him may i speak to the shift manager. So he went off and came with one of the guys. Not the manager. He said that the owner of the McDonald's closes early. I recommend people to go elsewhere and not here. Is not worth the time.,5 stars,5,1

The rep did not my order correct after I repeated it to him twice. When I got to the pick up window I told the rep I was missing nuggets and she said I was not charged for it. I told her that I would pay for it and said it was ok. She then gave me a 10 piece nugget instead of 6 I don't know where she got those nuggets from but they were ice cold. I felt so bad because my son bit into them and was so disappointed. Although I was less than a minute away I refused to go back because I felt that was done spitefully.

Well, my normal favorite is the quarter pounder with cheese .... today it was that Spain inspired burger. I guess it was the cheese or the sauce(normally I don't like sauces on my burger) but I don't know if it was the combination of bacon, the different cheeses or what, but it was soooo good. Yum I will have to come back to this McDonalds. I don't think they sell this burger in just any McDonalds, I think it has to be in one of the safari themed ones. Anyway it was really good!

Tonight I had dinner at McDonald's at Kalakaua & Liluokalani at approximately 9:50 pm Hawaiian time. I purchased 2 Fillet burgers; a small French fry and a senior small coffee.
After finishing I TRIED to receive a medium Mocha frappï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. According to Your McDonald's app I could get a FREE medium cafe without a purchase. I had received a FREE one before. One of your manager; Diana assisted a clerk as she encountered a problem. On your screen it had mentioned; with purchase; whereas Your app noted FREE. Diana asked me to wait till 11 pm when another manager was scheduled to come in. Crazy. She wanted to wait. After a few exchanges of options to her as I got aggravated. She said; I can call 911! What? What type of training do YOU; McDonald's Corporation of America PROVIDE or HAWAII .....? I have complained so many times it is not funny. To avoid lawsuits better training is uhio McDonald's.

"Update (12-29-2022): I visited this location again around the same time and the food was hot and fresh. Ordered 60 chicken nuggets, 2 fries, 2 large drinks, and 10 apple pies. We had to wait 10 minutes for the pies which is understandable because they take awhile and they don't usually have that many of them just sitting around.

Went pretty late at night (close to 1 AM) and the fries were surprisingly hot and my Shamrock Shake wasn't melted. I did ordered using the app and had zero issues. It was an unusually pleasant McDonald's experience and I will be a repeat customer at this location.",5 stars,5,1

They messed up a simple order like a four piece Chicken Mcnugget and a beverage. The young lady taking the order misunderstood me when I be asked for a Orange drink and charged for a Orange juice. So when I went to the window I thought the order was confirmed and corrected and the price was lowered but to no avail when I received my beverage it was a Orange soda. I wet around the drive through again spoke to the manager and she apologized. Last visit to this McDonald's.,1 star,1,0

"I didn't used to mind this McD's.  I was happy there was an option for 24-hr food in case I wanted something on the way home from a night out with friends or just late-night munchies.  During the day, it's a pretty average McD's.  But they lost my business forever when I went by one night at 1am, pulled up to the order box, waited for five minutes, then finally someone came over the speaker and said ""Sorry we're closed"".

Closed?!  It's 24-hrs!  And I get it, sometimes 24-hr places will close one night every several months to do a deep cleaning.  I get that, I really do.  But they ALWAYS post signs and notices so you're not blind-sided by it.  Not this place.  I really don't think they were closed.  I think the workers were too lazy to do their job and decided to shut the store down so they could get paid to do nothing.

Additionally, this store has a bad habit of having a ""broken"" ice cream machine past 10pm.  It's always ""sorry, ice cream machine is broken"" if you come in after the lobby closes.

The worst part is I complained on the website.  I submitted a complaint for this store, pointing out the 24-hr and the ice cream issue.  All I got back (weeks later) was ""oh, sorry the ice cream machine was broken, we're working to upgrade all our locations but it takes time""  Not even a single MENTION of the ""closed"" 24-hr location.

I mean it's McDonald's right? You know what to expect from the food which is both a plus and a minus. However at this particular McDonald's right on Garnet in Pacific Beach they are undergoing Construction. It seems like a complete redo the outside and some of the guest areas as well. It's a mess and noisy but does not look like any RI modeling of the kitchen area is being done. That makes me wonder why this has become the worst drive-through around even before the construction. Two cars in front of me still waited almost 10 minutes. Isn't that a lot from McDonald's? Or foremost drive-thrus these days it seems to be way too much time. Now I'm not just saying this because of today's visit this is been the case at this McDonald's now for the past couple of months. Maybe it's short-handed help but that would only be an excuse for once in awhile. Anyway not a great experience but probably should be eating elsewhere anyway.,2 stars,2,0

"It's a shame that I have to rate Mcdonalds a 1 star, but the service I received tonight was by far the worst I have experience and it needs to be addressed because now I will not be going back but the young lady that was working drive thru tonight her name is Elise was very rude and can not believe the way she talks to customers this is how exactly it went word for word and I work in customer service so I know how customers can be over the top when there complaining but word for word this is how it was, I honked my horn as I was in drive thru after I received my food because I had asked for ranch sauce and was given buffalo, keep in mind this is not a big deal for me and I will not be rude to the young lady over this but she took my honk as i did not have manners which is by far not my intentions I was simply trying to get her attention. She opened the window and asked me with a attitude Did you just honk? And started going off on me about manners, by then i was so upset that i just told her just hand me my ranch i will not argue with you as she still was holding the ranch still going off I then told her are you kidding me just give me the ranch and explained to her since I pulled up to this window you have had a rude attitude but that was not my place to get upset over that if she was having a bad night I just wanted my order so I can get back to work, as I addressed her attitude she then said to me Why cause I'm black? I was so beyond upset I have never been talk to this way from any restaurant and really do not know what this girls deal was and how did it lead to her assuming it was about her being black.

The girl at the register had no idea what she was doing. She had the assistant manager come help her she had no idea what she was doing... Then the manager came and we had now told them over 7 times to just take off the drinks... The manager still had a hard time....
How hard is it to take 2 drinks off an order.
He then was trying to say we had to pay for the fries. He eventually just let us have the fries for free. We also had a second order with another large fries. (we had 2 phone's with Free fries)

"This McDonalds sucks. They recently had a remodel which means the inside is nice and they have the fancy double drive-thru, but unfortunately the remodel could not fix the main issue with this McDonalds: The management.

The management is either not training employees properly or teaching them to bend the rules to keep a good drive-thru timer, because you will always have to pull up at this McD's. Always. Even for perfectly reasonable orders at perfectly reasonable times (1 burger + fry at 3pm = pull up next to the 3-4 other cars already there).

The one manager I've had the displeasure of dealing with was rude as well. I had to go back due to them forgetting several items on an order (that I had to pull up and wait for more than 5 minutes for, no less) and decided I just wanted it refunded to my card. The manager was rude about refusing to put it back on the card and insisting on giving me cash. The best part? He made me pull up to get the cash.

Well, my normal favorite is the quarter pounder with cheese .... today it was that Spain inspired burger. I guess it was the cheese or the sauce(normally I don't like sauces on my burger) but I don't know if it was the combination of bacon, the different cheeses or what, but it was soooo good. Yum I will have to come back to this McDonalds. I don't think they sell this burger in just any McDonalds, I think it has to be in one of the safari themed ones. Anyway it was really good!

In a 22$ order, we were missing 2 items equaling 8$ and a sweet and sour sauce that they charged me 2$ for. After going back and telling them what happened, they argued. I eventually got the egg sandwich and double bacon cheeseburger, which ended up having no bacon. Still never got that 2$ sweet and sour.",1 star,1,0

This is a very convenient location. Probably the most affordable food in this area near the pier. It's usually very busy with foot traffic for the beach and the promenade. You will encounter all types from international tourist to local bums. It's fairly clean considering the large amount of customers. The orders are quick but be sure to check it before leaving.

Seating was easy to find and the tables were clean. Employees were helpful. The arcade upstairs seemed pretty cool and definitely unique. We didn't play any games or play in the play place. I enjoyed seeing Mac Tonight playing the piano. Next time I'll get some dessert.",4 stars,4,1

In the bag was a fillet o fish (which to my surprise was the only fresh thing), 2 medium 5 year old fries, and 2- 10 year old cheeseburgers...seriously, the cheeseburgers were so old the cheese was crusting. Where is the quality????? They don't care if people are upset and/or get food poisoning?? Granted my husband should have checked the bag before leaving, but he didn't think to (not surprised). I was definitely upset the order was wrong and said whatever and we were going to eat it because we basically got smaller fries, but an extra sandwich, but those CHEESEBURGERS were so horrendous that whoever put that order together should be fired because it was just wrong..meat and cheese was well past shelf life and the pics I upload will show it.

"I've worked in the neighborhood for decades and this was always a decent go to place for a late night snack.

A couple of years ago they modified the interior- they removed a lot of seats on the main floor in order to install electronic order kiosks.  There are now only a handful of places to sit in a ridiculously cramped manner.  Late at night they close the upstairs- leaving pretty much nowhere decent to sit and eat.  Tonight I saw two people eating over the garbage cans and one eating by the soda dispenser.

The kiosks are annoying.  They ask if you want to take out or eat there.  If you select ""Eat In"", before you can pay for your order you're asked to get a table marker and enter the marker number.  Thing is there are absolutely no table markers- you cannot complete your order without one- unless you start over and select ""take out"".

During the day perhaps eating in makes sense- but late at night it's really only for take out.",2 stars,2,0

Long wait to pick up order, took like 20 minutes. Once you get your order it is missing items from your order. Today, I was missing hashbrowns. I also ordered hot chocolate with caramel and I got coffee  instead. I did not change it because two weeks ago, the same thing happened and I had to wait 20 more minutes for them to give me the hot chocolate.

"From a quick visit about 4 months ago:

Dining room was small, seemed clean (my order was to-go so didn't spend much time inside).

Loved the digital menu/self-order kiosks (ordered at the kiosk and it still gave the option to pay cash at the register, though not sure if that option's still available and/or if the dining room's even open right now...?).

Staff was friendly enough and very helpful, packed my to-go order like absolute pros.

The area where the fountain drinks, straws, etc., are wasn't super tidy (a bit of a spill on the countertop, if memory serves); however, seemed clean, otherwise.

Because it was such a quick trip, didn't get to see the condition of the bathrooms (a good indicator of an establishment's working and overall conditions, in my experience). Maybe another time?

Overall, a good experience.

Something to consider: there's no drive-through nor a parking lot and finding a parking space seems to be a nightmare/hit-or-miss in that area. Circled the surrounding blocks a few times before someone parked almost right in front of the store just happened to be leaving (not sure how often that happens, though). Score!

The previous parking spot I'd found was about 2 blocks away (doable), but kept searching in order to be closer to the other establishment my group and I were visiting prior to McD's.",4 stars,4,1

This is definitely not a place to go if you're looking for fast food. I could have done better with a local diner.
On top of that it was the worst tasting sweet tea I had ever tasted. There was hardly any ice so it was warm, it was mostly water and the flavor was like a mixture of regular tea and watered down sweet tea.

"Do not eat here, save yourself, time and money. I ordered here 5 times in a month and every time it was wrong. you would think I would learn. I tried to make it easy on them and ordered my burgers plain. Thinking the less work the better. Nope some how plain means ketchup only. Another time they put tartar sauce on my cheese burger. The managers tell you if you have a problem to just call the McD's number to complain. I am local so I have choices to eat at other places. You know what Wendy's is sounding a lot better these days. It's not even a short staff problem, its a I don't care problem. I must be a slow learner but trust me this McD ruined it for all others. losing my $45 order each trip wont hurt then in the short term.

"I happen to love Tommy's, but it definitely is not everyone's cup of tea. Their chili burger is their traditional specialty. It has meat, chili, tomato, onions, and pickle. The chili seems greasy but I love it.

Tommy's is an acquired taste. I've been going to the original tommys since 1968 in Los Angeles at Beverly and rampart. That shack is open twenty-four hours a day, and you basically eat outside, putting your food on a ledge and standing to eat it.

This Tommy's is a more traditional restaurant, where are you give your order inside, pick it up and sit down in comfort.

I love that the fries are large because they hold the heat much longer than small fries.

I used to order extra chili with my hamburger, and it made things very messy. What I learned at this visit was to have the chili put on the side, so I could add it as I wanted.

there are many different types and flavors to chili. This was brought home to me one time when I was at the original Tommy's and picked up my burger and drink right after a couple. They ended up eating nearby, and I heard the mail of the couple exclaim, ""That's not good chili!""

I was wondering what part of the Southwest he was from because of his critique. I just about choked on my drink when I heard him say, ""If you want good chili, you need to come to New York!""

I'm sure that there are good places to get chili in New York, but that guy was probably one of the people that considers everything west of the Hudson River to be a dining desert.",5 stars,5,1

I would rate it a 1 star but people would not take my review seriously. I visited this restaurant last night. It was very clean including the bathroom. At this time there was one cashier with a huge line and a bunch of people waiting for their order. The cashier was overloaded and the manager told everyone to order at the kiosks and not the register. This wasn't possible because nobody could pay at the kiosk; they had to get a receipt and pay at the register. I left 20 minutes later and went to Wendy's when the line had barely moved.,2 stars,2,0

If you are trying to be like Chick-fil-A, you're facilities were not built to serve that operating model nor are your employees trained to work that way efficiently.

"I come here quite often, and for the most part, it's a normal McDonald's. There is one manager here that frequently yells at his employees for no reason at all, IN FRONT OF THE CUSTOMERS! I honestly feel bad that they have to be treated like that because apparently the manager doesn't understand that places get busy and there will be a wait a bit longer than usual. This location always has homeless people standing/sitting at each exit of the parking lot. One hot, summer day, I was leaving this McDonald's and made the mistake of putting down my windows down before leaving the parking lot. I was stopped by one homeless man and he asked for money, and usually I don't carry cash, but I happened to have a couple quarters in my car, so I gave them to him and he thanked me for helping him and his brother out. I pulled forward a bit more, and his brother stood up, walked over to my car, and I thought he was just going to thank me for the money, but nope! He literally started climbing inside my car to get some food from the passenger seat. He was grabbing me, and had his hands on my steering wheel and I started driving away to get him to stop after offering him some more quarters so he could buy his own food, and he kept yelling at me saying that he wanted the food I had. In the end, I left being robbed of the few bucks I had in coins in my car, and feeling very much violated. Again, this could have been avoided by having my windows up, but I thought it would be worth including that experience in my review. Really not a bad place, but definitely not the best.",3 stars,3,0

"Stuff is super polite and nice and helpful. 4 stars because if you pay at a kiosk, grab a receipt and a table number, find a place, proudly install the number on top of it and wait you are sort of in a limbo: your order is not shown on any display, you have no clue when and how you will be served.
We waited for a good 20 min and then I just asked a very nice and polite servant if I did everything correctly and when we will be served. He said all is ok and they just have too many orders at this time but he said I will help.
Suggestion to the higher management.
All orders numbers have to be on one of the displays otherwise there are no feedback to the paid clients and with a less passionate clients you may have issues.
What is for sure is that this situation decreases efficiency of the floor workers since the current state of kiosk order processing creates a situation in which ppl will be asking questions that can easily be fixed by software upgrade!!

I had the worst experience at this location. I went to the drive thru and only ordered 2 hamburgers and a small fry. I paid and pulled up to get my food and was given the wrong order. I let the associate know it wasn't correct. He had me pull up to the wait window to get my correct food. As I sat and waited time was just ticking by. After 15 minutes of patiently waiting I wanted my food. No one came back. I knocked on the glass and no response. As about the 10th car received there food at the window behind me I had to get out of the car and walk back to that window as it was late and the inside was closed. I asked where my food was and he said he was making it. I asked for a refund and was given my slip refund a total of 28 minutes after first paying. I went back in the next day to speak with a manager to let them know that this happened. I had my receipt with the time and the refund receipt with the time 28 minutes later. He said oh I'm sorry they're new. Terrible customer service and uncaring management.,1 star,1,0

I parked and decided to order inside but the door was locked, even though they were OPEN! the 2 employees inside were just standing there doing nothing, they saw me knock and purposefully completely ignored me.

I'd say a below average McDonald's. Very dirty and lots of homeless on weekends I've been here. No friendly workers here which is a McDonald's usual but you do generally get what you order somewhat quickly. It is probably as cheap as you'll get in the area.,2 stars,2,0

"Worst McDonald's experience ever.  Do not visit this location. It doesn't matter how many times you ask for a special request with your food, they will still make it wrong and than lie to you when they give it to confirming your request was done, when in fact it was wrong the whole time.  They will not give you your complete order the first time, you have to drive around and wait inline again or go inside to get your order correct, and if you don't double check it at the counter, they may get it wrong again. I do not recommend this location to anyone. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",1 star,1,0

"My experience visiting this place was not good. It was not because the place that is a nice building with many things to do specially for kids but for the service. This McDonald's offers Pasta and Pizza and I had the terrible idea of order a pizza along with many other things. I have to wait more then an hour and 15 minutes for it.  The place was plenty of tourists many of them in groups like mine and most of them had the same problem. The staff attention was not good. They were overwhelmed and didn't warning about the long waiting time. In some cases one hour and a half. This is considered the largest McDonald's in the World so it is another tourist attraction in the city. They should improve their service, especially in the pizza area. As a positive comment, I received a second ration of one of my orders for free in retribution for the long wait. My recomendation is not to order pizza if you are in a hurry, with a large group and during busy times.",2 stars,2,0
This has to be one of the best McDonald's I have ever been to hands down. While disappointingly I did not visit the upstairs with the arcade machines I can rave about the pasta and pizza they make and serve! The pasta can rival olive garden and starts at 10.99 and you are able to customize it how you want. Definitely would recommend both the pasta and even the pizza! I'm pretty picky on pizza and the pepperoni pizza was actually pretty good! I usually would HATE brick oven pizza as I find they taste burnt always but this was a good pizza! Definitely worth checking out at least once if you are in the area! It is a little busy most times but even with that the wait is no worse than a regular McDonald's.,5 stars,5,1

Despite the most important thing to me being wanting to order with a human being, ordering at the kiosk took longer and was more difficult than ordering with a human...and I wanted to pay cash which required I go to a cashier after ordering at the kiosk, very frustrating. Also, the new fountain drink machines are equally aweful, I will never order a drink from a machine that dispenses all drinks from one spout because no matter what you dispense it always tastes like a mix of more than one drink. Why has McDonalds chosen to fix what wasn't broken and use systems and machines which customers so clearly dislike?",2 stars,2,0

You tell them the situation and they look at you like it's your fault and dont even apologize for any inconvenience they have caused you.

Had to trim off parts that were either undercooked or too hard to eat. And with burger being so dry its almost like you need a medium drink to even eat the burger, and sadly I started with the fries. And to top it all off after using a card in the drive through i never got a receipt. Never going back. Would rather go to checkers across the street.",2 stars,2,0

Tonight, I realized that they forgot an item after coming home with food for the family. I first tried to call just to get reimbursed...but no one answered the phone.

Then I decided to drive back for a refund while the rest of my food went cold on my dining room table. When I got to the drive thru, I politely asked for a refund for the item they forgot.

Having worked in the food industry myself in the past, the service was awful. For the sheer inconvenience, they should have refunded me and at least offered the missing item to me free of charge. However, all that was given was a refund...not even an apology to go along with it.

Terrible service along with the terrible cold food that I then had to go eat at home (thanks to my having to drive back for a refund).

I got my food 8 minutes later and drove off so I could get the food to the house. Almost home, I look in the bag and grab a fry, because mcdonalds fries fresh are freaking delicious. Yeah no, I bit 5 fries all at once and they were soggy and unsalted. Highly disappointed. I tried to call and the phone just rang.

Then when I pulled up to the first window the one that was so rude was the one that has a ring in her nose she is african american she did not even bother to repeat my order and did not offer to give me receipt.

I'm taking my Son to work and decide to stop and get him lunch, and as soon as I'm ordering through  the intercom , I can already tell the demeanor of the worker was comming off pretty rude.  Once. We approached the window , when I gave her my code for my McDonald's Rewards she right away got even more rude with her whole body and facial expressions and didn't want to take my code , but in a very bad mood overall. Her attitude was so unpleasant. Being a McDonald's customer for years, I Didn't appreciate her behavior , she just ruined my whole mood and day. Her manager came to explain to me the situation in a much calmer , respectful manner. I mean, thats all Griselda had to do. Employees like this need to get trained better on how to properly interact with customers. Once you're clocked in, you're clocked in and should be ready to go. Trust me. I know. I've worked in customer service for 18 years. So I hope this McDonald's location properly trains Griselda accordingly.",1 star,1,0

While waiting in line , I heard the kitchen staff say there is no sauce for the extreme, should we give it to them anyway? With no intentions of me hearing .
When my order came out, no one informed us there was no sauce , didnt ask us when making it if we still wanted it , another sandwich or my money back ..
I told them I heard them and they denied it , then said that they told someone else to let me know there was missing items for the sandwich . But she didnt , (I could hear them) and why would she make it without confirmation if she DID tell someone to ask ??
I also noticed there was 2 tomatoes instead of 3 that i paid extra for, same goes for the pickles I asked extra for .
I got a male employees attention and told him , hey this isn't correct...etc. he hot an attitude , rolled his eyes turned his back on me to continue what he was doing previously .
The only saving grace was a lady named Elyce , someone who I thought was a manager but she is only a crew member.
She intervened, corrected my order . The only one who helped . She deserves a raise// a reward . Thank you .

I tried to complain about Mario who did not respond appropriately (couldn't be bothered to make any verbal response) but had to wait forever for Stephanie as she was putting out fires all over the restaurant. You could not pay me to work with Mario or the newly appointed manager who was called to speak with me  but never came over despite eye contact and him making a grumpy sound(young, black guy who was more into showing off in front of the young female staff than treating any woman with respect).
What ever the main manager, Stephanie is being paid isn't enough. I saw her run, rule, command the show in a way that got the job done. She was gracious with all customers whilst her staff were ignorant gits.",1 star,1,0

I would  Give this McDonald's 0 stars if I could they don't only forget your sauces for your nuggets but they give you a Burger with a paper still on the Patty cooked with cheese on it. I bit into my Burger and I chewed it right away I tasted the paper.. Took my Burger apart and found the paper that's on the Burger Patty before it's cooked . Be more careful.

"Another experience.

I was asked to wait at drive thru. No other customers were in queue. They forgot about me. The order was reduced without telling me. The apple pies were removed without any explanation. When I called to report the issue a woman who answered the phone saying she was the manager didn't identify herself. She was rude and short and when I asked for her name she wouldn't provide it. Bad experience with the food too. The fries were so over salted I couldn't eat them and the big mac had so much lettuce and sauce on it I was wondering what happened in the kitchen. End to end bad experience.

Hello I came to your restaurant this morning and waited an extremely long time and was ignored by your staff. I waited at the drive thru order kiosk, then at the payment window and then at the pick up window. Your staff saw me waiting making eye contact several times but continuing to ignore me. I moved back to the payment window and waited while several cars pulled up waiting too. When Mitzy who had ignored me finally opened the window was really dismissive with her demeanor before taking my order. I asked why she saw me and continued to make me wait. Her response was I just put on the headset. Seriously that was her response. There were at least four of the staff who saw me so I am really frustrated with your customer service. Why didn't she acknowledge that she kept me waiting and just apologized for the delay like a normal person. I was really offended that she was so flippant when I asked her about making me wait. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and lack of basic human kindness. NOT LOVING IT.

Visited again on 3/17/2018 and had the same experience. Even the white shirt manager ignored me.",1 star,1,0

Be aware this location starts breakfast at 4am however during late hours they shut their systems down meaning they only take cash, and mobile orders are not accepted, and the mobile app is not updated to make yiuu aware of this. Maybe it's legit, seems shady though. If anything it is poor management. It is understandable to shut down system during slower times if need be.

"Hello,

I hope this email finds you to inform you that your staff needs to be engaged in coaching due to the lack of attention to a female and I needing to use the restrooms after multiple attempts to utilize them. I was ignored by the first female and was given a puzzled look that they can't be opened. After I went around to seek attention from the other staff she rudely stated both bathrooms are not available, after I asked why she said "" they just are "". I asked to see what would cause them to be unusable but could only feel discriminated as she added no urgency to the issue. She then asked if I was management to even request to see the inside of the bathrooms. As a LONG TIME CUSTOMER. I suggest to keep your client based loyal to address this issue as it leaves a bad image on the franchise. I left feeling ""I didn't have it my way "". And that's just a bowl movement. Thank you for your time and I hope this matter has been addressed the next time I pass by the store as I will try to obtain pictures of the staff reluctant to assist.

Best regards,

JJ.",1 star,1,0

Mosr of the food was delivered after we were sent to the parking lot since it was 2 big breakfasts and a mcgriddle with 3 drinks.

Id give it zero starts if I could. The drive through only had two cars ahead of me to order and in total it took an hour. It took ten minutes no exaggeration at the order board for someone to take my order. When i get to the window he didnt know what i had and literally just then put my order in. It was not that busy at all and it had at least 4 people working. At the window he took my card for about two minutes and i froze my bank account just in case,1 star,1,0

"From the moment I pulled up after ordering literally had ZERO words spoken to me by the drive thru guy. He just gave me dirty looks. Then after taking my credit card he took his cell phone out looking like he was stealing my credit card information. I asked for my receipt which was given with a hateful look but still no words. I called MULTIPLE times and left multiple messages before I got a call back from a person stating they were the manager. They said they pulled the video and he was just texting no picture. He could be texting my credit card info. I still don't feel comfortable with this and my card is still frozen. Mcdonalds once they take my card is accepting responsibility for any fraud /theft and PCI DSS compliance. If their employee did in fact steal my CC I am filing criminal charges against the employee and McDonalds for not being PCI and PII compliant. The auditor in me will not allow this. Even if he truly is innocent, the perception with the influx of cyber crime should never happen. Do not have your cell phone out when holding someone's credit card.",1 star,1,0

This McDonalds forces customers to use the new machines. I couldn't order a large orange juice on my breakfast meal so I asked an employee for help. She didn't know how to order that from the machine either. She told me just order the small and that she would get me a large. While I'm waiting for my order another employee (I think it was the manager) told me I owed 50 cents for the large orange juice. She seemed annoyed with me and maybe the young girl too because we didn't know how to order the large OJ  I paid the 50 cents but was unhappy with how unfriendly and the whole experience was.

"Number of times we've ordered from this McDonalds: 3
Number of times they've gotten the order right: 0

It cannot be spelled out any clearer. ""Quarter pounder. Absolutely nothing on it. No cheese. Just the meat and the bun."" It is so simple. Under normal circumstances I would stick around for them to get it right. But they have a steady supply of drugged out homeless people begging for money right there in the drive through line, so running that gauntlet a second time is downright dangerous.

So I get home to see if i can salvage this order. Pull the bun all the way off to start scraping fake cheese off of it. The stale, burned bun breaks (picture). I successfully scrape the cheese product off the top only to find there's another slice of fake cheese underneath the patty as well.

I give up. #FightFor15, indeed",1 star,1,0

"Really frustrated with this location. I usually go to the location off of Beach street and order the same thing every time I go there. I know exactly how much my order should be. I stop here because I happened to be closer to this location than to my normal one and order my usual. 2 McDoubles. I had just enough change in my wallet to pay for my order. Or so I thought. Instead of paying $1.50 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 2 + .25 = $3.25, I was charged $1.99 for ONE Mcdouble. It may not seem like much, but to someone who is on the go and on a budget I expect ome of the biggest fast food chains to at the very least be consistent with their prices. I wonder how much I've over paid at this location in the past!
What made me most upset was that I didnt recieve a receipt for my order. So in order to determine why I paid $2.15 after tax for ONE Mcdouble, I went inside to the self ordering in the lobby and looked it up myself. I dont appreciate not being told my total at the speaker, not beinzing I didnt even receive one to begin with when I pulled forward from the pick up window.

"Every single time I have gone through the drive thru at this location, it has taken at least 20 minutes to complete the transaction. They have a sauce they're advertising on a poster at the drive through that says ""Honey"" sauce, but when you get to the window, no one knows what you're talking about.
Anyhow, the most recent experience was a great example of poor customer service and why we won't be returning to this location.
Waiting at the drive thru for almost half an hour like usual, the manager comes to the window where they give you your food and says that our (my husband and I's) nuggets aren't done yet and requests us to park nearby to wait. That's fine, as we do so without complaint. The manager comes out 5-10 minutes later to give us our food. We take it and get home to find that the bottom box in the bag was some nasty ass Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich, and not 20piece nuggets. That's not what we paid for or ordered. We go back to this McDonalds another day and ask for the manager; his employees had to yell for him and almost convince him to come up to the window, as I heard them yelling to him, ""They want to talk to you!"" countless times, as if he asked out of frustration and anger. After he was torn away from the slow work he wasn't helping with while in his office, he pretended he didn't understand what I said and said he couldn't write anything or give me a coupon for anything since he didn't have some kind of coupon book? I asked him if he could give us  what we bought next time since we had already paid. He said yes and we left. Yesterday was the last day we visited this location; and we asked for the manager at the first pay window. He acted like he had no idea who we were after that whole ordeal and gave us HALF off our 20 piece nuggets that we were buying! He lied to our faces after he said he would take care of it! You would think how much revenue, McDonalds brings in, the manager wouldn't be so stingy and would apologize and provide what's necessary to remediate the situation! He acted so snide and unapologetic too. Needless to say, experiencing slow service, disrespect and a poor account of responsibilities; we won't be returning.",1 star,1,0

I pull up to drive thru and told to wait a moment. I wait 30 minutes to place order still nobody takes my order. I pull up to window thinking maybe I was forgotten. I honking horn employees looks at me and walks away. I stay there for another 15 minutes waiting and still nobody takes my order. And all the while I watch at least 12 other cars pull up to drive thru sit and wait and eventually leave cause nobody is taking orders. If your not going to do your job as an employee of McDonald's let the customers know so they don't have to wait  for nothing. By the way I had to give one star to post this.

"All around the inside is Fair. but need to check air vents its dirty. All Soda Machine need to be constantly  watched because  when its busy it gets nasty and dirty .. floor looks clean but need more cleaning. and the windows all around need to be cleaned, and of course the frame.

Very Impressive One As far as the overall look.

Managers and Staff need to be reminded and or trained that a Franchise who really depends on Customers to have more happy people to come to visit and eat here.

Customer Service is Very Poor. Your Cashier Staff or Front Staff is not following their training. And why is it I walk in and I was stared by your staff and like they don't like to be friendly and all showing , how great and wonderful to have a job ..that lets you interact with people ..This is one of the most questioned part of Hiring. Are a People Person? Are good or happy to be around People. ETC.,

The Outside Area is good , Actually better than good.

Food is very good , but prepared Sloppy on my tray and the way it was wrap and coffee I have to dump some because they fill it to the top. I mean they can save a lot of coffee expense and time making sure ask the customer if they want it fill to the top or not...

So, you have good location ,, ok dining area , staff not satisfied, not customer service oriented plus the Manager is he or she really watching the staff and or helping to correct any discrepancies or problems?

This is THE MC DONALD WHO GENERATE  a lot of the revenue because of its best quality fast food deals and environment ...and GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.",4 stars,4,1

"Say what you want about McDonald's, but this location has it figured out! I really hate that I forgot to take pictures for you guys, but go here! They have order kiosks and you can have your food brought to you by one of the staff.
Something that doesn't happen often with McDonald's, but this location really was clean. There was a modern aesthetic to it, along with the pastries (never seen at anothr McDonald's).
The food did take a while but considering the wait volume (-20/30) people, I can understand.
Overall, this is a great place for cheap food to go and to stay. If you're not specific about the way you like your food, order at the kiosk (get a table marker) and go on upstairs and find yourself a table.",5 stars,5,1

The rep did not my order correct after I repeated it to him twice. When I got to the pick up window I told the rep I was missing nuggets and she said I was not charged for it. I told her that I would pay for it and said it was ok. She then gave me a 10 piece nugget instead of 6 I don't know where she got those nuggets from but they were ice cold. I felt so bad because my son bit into them and was so disappointed. Although I was less than a minute away I refused to go back because I felt that was done spitefully.

That in itself is a whole different issue and honestly very difficult to figure out without driving down an unlit window on a drive-thru with a sign stating ""we're open 24 Hours..""
